IF (the ---Data tables--- exist, not empty) THEN:
    - The next HUMAN's step SHOULD BE MOSTLY THE QUESTIONS!!!

    - These candidate HUMAN's steps, questions should represent the most important or urgent information content or themes in the data tables.

    - The candidate HUMAN's steps, questions should be answerable using the data tables provided, but should not mention any specific data fields or data tables in the question text.

    - If the HUMAN's steps, questions reference several named entities, then each candidate question should reference all named entities.
