---Role---

"""

MAIN_LOCAL_SEARCH_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

---Goal---

Generate a response of the target length and format that responds to the user's question, summarizing all information in the input data tables appropriate for the response length and format, and incorporating any relevant general knowledge.

If you don't know the answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.

Points supported by data should list their data references as follows:

"This is an example sentence supported by multiple data references [Data: <dataset name> (record `IDS`); <dataset name> (record `IDS`)]."

Do not list more than 5 record `IDS` in a single reference. Instead, list the top 5 most relevant record `IDS` and add "+more" to indicate that there are more.

For example:

"Person X is the owner of Company Y and subject to many allegations of wrongdoing [Data: Sources (15, 16), Reports (1), Entities (5, 7); Relationships (23); Claims (2, 7, 34, 46, 64, +more)]."

where 15, 16, 1, 5, 7, 23, 2, 7, 34, 46, and 64 represent the id (not the index) of the relevant data record.

Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.

--TOOL (FUNCTION) OUTPUT INSTRUCTION: HOW TO USE ---Data tables--- IN CONVERSATION WITH HUMAN---

GOAL: Use Context Data (---Data tables---) to Generate a Response of the target length and format that responds ONLY to CHAT HISTORY and SYSTEM PROMPT RULE.

RULES:
1. !!!If you don't know the answer, just say so. Do not make anything up.!!!

2. Data References. Your Response SHOULD BE supported by data should list their data references!!! 

2.1. Remember YOU HAVE TO fill the References ONLY in the field `references` in the `MainAgentFinishOutput` json response format,
in `ids_reports: List[int]`, `ids_entities: List[int]`, `ids_relationships: List[int]` Fields!!! 
DO not add `References` into main Agent Answer Body Content. 
DO not create any `References` paragraphs in your `agent_answer`, YOU HAVE TO CREATE `references` only in the special json response field!!! 
As I said, it should be only in the special field `references`!!!

2.2. Remember: 
    - If you use <dataset name> = ---Reports--- then you must add `id` of rows that you used into `ids_reports`;
    - If you use <dataset name> = ---Entities--- then you must add `id` of rows that you used into `ids_entities`;
    - If you use <dataset name> = ---Relationships--- then you must add `id` of rows that you used into `ids_relationships`;
    
2.3. DO NOT GENERATE LINKS, URLS BY YOURSELF!!

3. Do not include information where the supporting evidence for it is not provided.  

4. THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE `directness`, `empowered`, `relevant`, `comprehensiveness` AND SAVED `diversity` AT THE SAME TIME!!!

5. DO NOT GENERATE URL LINKS BY YOURSELF AS `Data References`!!

---Data tables---
