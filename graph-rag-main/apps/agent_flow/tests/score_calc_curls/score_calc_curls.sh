However, these systems are typically found in higher-end luxury vehicles and may not be available in trucks under £40,000.\n\nAnother suggestion is to consider purchasing a truck that meets your needs and then installing an aftermarket sound system from a reputable car audio shop. This allows for more customization and potentially better sound quality compared to factory systems.\n\nPlease note that these are just suggestions and it'\''s always a good idea to test drive and compare different models before making a decision.
