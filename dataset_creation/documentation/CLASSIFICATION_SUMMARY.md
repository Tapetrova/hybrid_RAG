## Conclusion

The classification reveals an ideal distribution for demonstrating CKG-RAG advantages:
- **33.4%** of questions (causal + diagnostic) directly benefit from causal reasoning
- High classification confidence ensures clean experimental results
- Sufficient questions per category for statistical significance
- Clear separation between categories minimizes experimental noise

This distribution strongly supports the paper's hypothesis that causal knowledge graphs enhance RAG performance on technical domain questions.
