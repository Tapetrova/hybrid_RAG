# Stack Exchange Scoring System Explained

## What is Stack Exchange Score?

Stack Exchange uses a community-driven voting system where users can vote on the quality and usefulness of questions and answers. This score reflects the collective judgment of the community about the value of content.

## How is the Score Calculated?

The score for a question is calculated as:
```
Score = Upvotes - Downvotes
```

- **Upvote (+1)**: Given when a question is useful, clear, and shows research effort
- **Downvote (-1)**: Given when a question is unclear, off-topic, or lacks effort

## Score Ranges and Interpretation

### Typical Score Distribution on Stack Exchange

| Score Range | Interpretation | Frequency | Quality Level |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|---------------|
| **< 0** | Poor quality, likely closed | ~5% | Very Low |
| **0-2** | Below average | ~30% | Low |
| **3-5** | Average question | ~25% | Medium |
| **6-10** | Good question | ~20% | Good |
| **11-20** | High quality | ~15% | High |
| **21-50** | Excellent, very useful | ~4% | Very High |
| **50+** | Exceptional, canonical | <1% | Exceptional |

## Our Dataset Statistics

For the **706 automotive questions** in our dataset:

### Score Distribution
- **Minimum Score**: 4 (no negative or very low scores)
- **Maximum Score**: 106 (exceptional question)
- **Average Score**: 11.6
- **Median Score**: 9.0

### Quality Breakdown
| Quality Level | Score Range | Count | Percentage |
|---------------|------------|-------|------------|
| High Quality | ≥ 10 | 326 | 46.2% |
| Very High Quality | ≥ 20 | 78 | 11.0% |
| Exceptional | ≥ 50 | 5 | 0.7% |

## What Does an 11.6 Average Score Mean?

An **average score of 11.6** is significantly above the typical Stack Exchange average (usually 3-5), indicating:

1. **High Quality Content**: Questions are well-written, clear, and specific
2. **Community Value**: The automotive community found these questions useful
3. **Research Effort**: Questions show prior research and thought
4. **Relevance**: Topics are relevant to many users
5. **Expert Engagement**: High scores often attract expert answers

## Factors Contributing to High Scores

Questions typically receive high scores when they:
- Address common automotive problems
- Are clearly written with specific details
- Include relevant context (car model, symptoms, what was tried)
- Can benefit multiple users (not just the asker)
- Lead to comprehensive, educational answers

## Examples from Our Dataset

### Exceptional Score (106 points)
**Question**: "Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?"
