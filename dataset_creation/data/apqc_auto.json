      "question": "Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear?",
      "context": "Does the act of downshifting to slow your vehicle down have any negative side affects? I don't downshift more than one or two gears at a time and I let out on the clutch slow enough that I don't rev very high. My red line is at 5.5 and mine are around 3 - 3.5 when I do it. This process makes my brakes last much longer but I'd like to ensure it's not at the cost of something else. Edit: Thanks everyone for your answers, but I'm seeing very conflicting information. I found this on wikipedia but then again it's wikipedia. Does anyone have anything to support their thought one way or another? Engine braking passively reduces wear on brakes and helps a driver maintain control of the vehicle. Active use of engine braking (shifting into a lower gear) is advantageous when it is necessary to control speed while driving down very steep and long slopes. It should be applied before regular disk or drum brakes have been used, leaving the brakes available to make emergency stops. The desired speed i",
      "answer": "Most of the time when you drive, you're putting a load (and causing wear) on what I'm going to call the \"forward\" face of each tooth on each gear in your drivetrain. The front of a tooth on the crankshaft pushes against the back of a tooth on the next gear in line, which pushes the next gear, etc. When you use \"engine braking\", all you are doing is engaging the teeth in the opposite direction, and putting force and wear on the faces that normally are just along for the ride. Now, does that mean you're wearing your engine out faster? Marginally... but the parts you're wearing out would normally have to be replaced (if at all) because they'd worn out from the other side; you're wearing surfaces that would usually be thrown out with hardly any wear at all. To borrow a phrase from the medical field, your engine/transmission will die with that wear, not of it. To the people who say that you're transferring the wear from your brakes to your clutch, all I can say is... you're doing it wrong! If you downshift as quickly and smoothly as you upshift, then the added wear and tear on your clutch will be a statistical blip - seriously, how many times do you downshift for this reason, as opposed to normal shifting? (If your answer is \"at every light\", then the poster who advised you to calm down your driving habits had a point.) Having said that, there's a seriously wrong way to do this; I used to do it when I was first learning to drive stick, and it was incredibly stupid: pushing the clutch all the way in and letting the RPMs fall to idle, then letting the clutch out and allowing the engine to slow the car down in the same gear. If that's how you're doing it, STOP IT! That way wears out the clutch very fast (which might be what the other posters had in mind), drops your speed dramatically without lighting up your brakelights (I confess, that's why I started doing it - trying to sneak-slow past a cop), and runs a high risk of stalling the engine and seriously ^&*@ing something u",

      "question": "Should I resurface or replace my rotors everytime I replace brake pads?",
      "context": "I have heard it is proper practice to replace or resurface your brake rotors every time your do a brake pad replacement. Does this need to be done every single time or is it overkill? Maybe it is just something easy to do, might as well replace while you are in there type of thing?",
      "answer": "The decision to replace is largely based on the thickness. The repair manual should tell you the minimum thickness, below which you should replace the rotors when doing the repair. Use a pair of calipers and measure the rotor thickness, if you're below this number you need to replace the rotors. You may also wish to replace the rotors if you have particularly heavy use planned and you are getting close to the limit. For example, if you live in the mountains, do a lot of towing, are planning to attend track days... You definitely need to get them resurfaced if they are warped or damaged. Usually you can feel if they are warped through the brake pedal when stopping -- instead of a smooth stop it will kind of vibrate or pulsate when braking at higher speeds. It's very noticeable. This can be measured with a dial gauge and checked against the repair manual's recommendations for \"runout\". You will need a dial gauge, and some sort of a mount to hold the gauge steady while you spin the rotor. Damage is usually caused by the old brake pads wearing completely through and tend to leave a very rough surface on the disc. These should definitely be turned, if possible. Before having a damaged or warped set of rotors turned, check their thickness. If they're close to the minimum, resurfacing them will leave you with rotors that are too thin. If you're at this point, you should have rotors that are thick enough and not damaged. Many people recommend resurfacing of them so the pads and rotors can better mate and wear into each-other. I tend to agree with this, but I have replaced pads on cars that I drive less spiritedly without resurfacing them, and have not had problems.",

      "question": "Why does my A/C blow foul smelling air when it first turns on?",
      "context": "Most of the time when I first turn on the A/C in our 2008 Toyota Sienna, the air that blows out has a very distinct chemical - nasty smell. After a while it seems to go away. I'm not sure if I just get used to the smell or it actually goes away. When I just turn on the fan with no A/C there is no smell. Also if I drive somewhere then leave shortly thereafter, it doesn't stink when I fire it up the 2nd (or subsequent) time. Should I be concerned for my health or safety?",
      "answer": "This is a common problem for all air conditioners (in a car or not), and is caused by mildew growth. In cars it often happens when people run their A/C on the recirculation all of the time, or the drain gets clogged. The system doesn't dry out completely and mildew starts to grow. You should be concerned about your health, especially if you have allergies. Just imagine all that mildew and god knows what else growing in there and being spewed in your face every time you turn the A/C on... Here's a link to US EPA page describing how mold may affect health, if you are still not convinced. The things you should do to remove the cause of your problem and prevent it from happening again: Run it on recirculation only when something stinks outside, or you want it to cool down quickly. Fresh air from outside will help it dry out better. Make sure that your A/C drain isn't clogged and there is no water building up. And this is what you could do to remove the unpleasant effects: Run the heater on full for a while, that will dry out the system and might 'cook' the mildew. Change your cabin air filter (if you have one). There are special sprays sold to remove the mildew from the A/C system (read the instructions carefully before using them). Just using Lysol or some other stuff like that will work too, but the smell will be more unpleasant. I suggest that you do all of this, and in the specified order.",

      "question": "What actually happens when there is not enough oil in a car engine?",
      "context": "When a car is topped up with oil, it clear to most people that you are supposed to fill it to the recommended amount as specified by the manufacturer (normally on a dip stick). What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the oil becomes too low?",
      "answer": "Engine oil does much more for an engine than lubricate. It provides cooling, cleaning, and a bunch of other chores. You already know engine function is degraded when you run out of oil. Let's see if we can run it down to make more sense for you how it happens. Let's say, for lack of argument, your engine is running with very little to no oil. The engine oil light is on as the engine is running. Antifreeze is up to snuff, but that won't stop overheating for too long. Here is what happens: As whatever limited oil is in the engine is pushed around, it becomes hotter and hotter. It becomes hotter because the oil isn't allowed enough time to cool down a little before it is required to go back into the engine and do its thing. As this happens, the oil will wear out faster. Fully synthetic oil will last longer than dino (refined) oil, but it will suffer defeat sooner or later as well. Several reactions happen to the oil, to include oxidation, thermal degradation, and compressive heating. Mind you, all of these things are created under normal use conditions (and thus the reason we change oils when we should), but under extreme conditions as you've suggested, it all happens much faster. This is a great image which describes what happens from the Machinery Lubrication website - All of this breakdown creates the regular: tar; sludge; varnish; soot; etc. All of these things start depositing on the internals of your engine, such as the rings, bearings, cylinder walls ... anywhere oil would normally flow. If you go back to your chemistry teachings, you'll probably remember that a large portion of oil is carbon. All of the previously mentioned nasty substances are actually a carbon byproducts. As these carbon substances continue to deposit, any part which comes in contact with them gets wear on them as carbon can become quite hard and/or sticky under the right circumstances. This starts creating more friction on these parts. So now instead of cooling/lubricating/cleaning, the oil ",

      "question": "How to maintain a sometimes-used vehicle?",
      "context": "My daily commute changed from 9 miles to 9 feet when I started working remotely. That means I very rarely drive my car much. After a particularly hectic month, I didn't drive for about 4 weeks and the car's battery had died the next time I came to drive it. So, what should I do to keep the car in good, running condition? What can keep the battery charged? Are trickle chargers recommended? How about oil? Should I make sure I take the car for a reasonable drive every week? Two weeks? What other aspects of the car should I keep in mind? Edit: Thanks to all who've answered to date. I've upvoted everyone, and am accepting Patrick's answer as the most informative. Edit 2: Also of interest to this topic: Reviving a vehicle that has been idle for a long time How long does it take for gas to go bad?",
      "answer": "Rule(s) of thumb: Drive the car once a week, long enough to get the engine to normal operating temperature. Change the oil every 3,000 miles, or since you are not driving much, every 3 months. If your car stays stationary for very long times you need to be concerned about dry rot or the rubber on the tires, but if you follow #1, you won't need to worry about this. About once a month drive the car for an extended time (>30 minutes), there can be water accumulation on sensors and exhaust as well as rust on brake rotors. You want to heat up the entire car including engine & exhaust system to evaporate any condensation to prevent rust buildup and clean the brake rotors to maintain the ability to stop. If the gas in the tank will be there for more than a month you need to put a gas stabilizer in the tank (à la STA-BIL) so that the gas does not degrade.",

However, I've always just hooked up both poles to the corresponding poles on the other car's battery. I've never experienced any negative consequences, and it has always worked fine. Out of curiosity, does it matter, and if so, why?",
      "answer": "From an electrical perspective, it doesn't matter. However, a lead-acid battery that is charging or discharging rapidly will give off hydrogen, which is highly explosive. Since you generally make the ground connection last, there's a good chance that you'll get a spark, which is enough to ignite the hydrogen. So while it's unlikely that you'll have anything explode, under extreme conditions it's possible. Making the ground connection away from the battery eliminates the possibility.",

      "answer": "According to 2010 Prius Emergency Response Guide (page 10): Being electronic, the gearshift selector and the park systems depend on the low voltage 12 Volt auxiliary battery for power. If the 12 Volt auxiliary battery is discharged or disconnected, the vehicle cannot be started and cannot be shifted out of park. The auxiliary battery is located in the cargo area.

      "context": "I have way too much oil in my Acura TSX. Do I need to take care of it without turning it on or can I drive it to a service station? If I need to do it in place, I don't have the ramps or a pan or the daylight left and my wife needs the car in the morning. Can I siphon the oil out of the top? If so, what type of tubing won't be dissolved by the oil? ======== If you want to laugh, yes I'm an idiot. The car's been great for years and years and I've never been good about checking the oil. Just regular oil changes and there's been no problem. The second to last oil change, they sold me on synthetic and said I'd be good for a year. Well, after a year and many miles, turned out the engine was almost dry! Apparently \"one year\" was a bad recommendation. No damage done, but close. Anyway, now I've been anxious about running out of oil, so I checked it an saw very little oil on the dipstick. Since it's been so long, I'd forgotten what to expect - \"that's a long piece of metal with nothing on it\",",
      "answer": "You haven't wrecked the car but you should get the oil down to the appropriate level. If the oil isn't hot, almost any sort of plastic tubing can be used for siphoning. It's easiest to go in via the dip stick. Remember not to use the \"suck start\" siphoning method as you don't want a mouthful of oil. If you have a long enough piece of tubing, you can stick the excess down the dipstick tube, put your thumb over the end, pull out the slack (that is now full of oil) and you'll have an immediate siphon. Also remember to siphon the oil back into the original container - you might as well keep it until you do need it. My vote is that you take care of it yourself - I hate letting other people know that I made a goof, especially if I can fix it myself.",

      "question": "what is the difference between DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluids?",
      "context": "What is the difference between DOT3 and DOT4 brake fluids? What could possibly go wrong if I use a (4 times cheaper) DOT3 brake fluid instead of the DOT4 which manufacturer recommends (but allows adding \"some\" DOT3 occasionally)? What will happen if I just use only DOT3?",
      "answer": "If the manual is saying small amounts of DOT3 can be used, what they are most likely saying is if you find yourself with low brake fluid and only DOT3 is available, it is better to use that than to not have brake fluid. Once you get back home though you need to get the recommended DOT4 back in the system by bleeding the system and filling with DOT4. As already stated, DOT4 handles higher heat. If your car is calling for DOT4, that means that the manufacturer does not feel comfortable that the braking system will not raise the brake fluid above a temperature that DOT3 can handle. Another point to make here is there are two boiling temperatures for brake fluid, Dry and Wet. When you've just replaced your brake fluid and the system has been properly bled, you are working at the Dry boiling temperature. Over time, water works its way into the system through age, heat cycling, through the hoses, etc. You are then working at your Wet boiling point for the fluid. So again, if you get stuck in a spot where you need to put some new brake fluid into the system and all you have available is DOT3, most likely at that point your DOT4 has degraded some and the fresh DOT3 will be close to where the DOT4 is at, but this won't stay true, the DOT3 will degrade once in the lines so the above statement of replace it as soon as possible holds true.",

      "context": "I need to replace my rear brake pads. A mechanic suggested I also replace my rotors because they are rusted around the edges. The rotors are in fact quite rusted, however, there is no rust on the actual surface that touches the pads. Running my fingers over the surface of the rotors, there does not appear to be any buildup of brake pad deposits and the surface is relatively smooth. There is however one small circular scratch around one of the rotors. While the pads are ready to be replaced, they are still within standard tolerances, so it's not like there is metal-on-metal going on. The mechanic warned that replacing the pads without replacing the rotors at the same time would be a waste because the rusted rotors will just eat up the new pads. I find that hard to believe given that the rust is just on the extreme edges of the rotors, which are parts that do not appear to touch the pads. The brakes do not appear to make any abnormal noises at all. Therefore, according to this post, it d",
      "answer": "It's not required that you replace your brake rotors at the same time you replace your brake pads, but there are many reasons why it's highly recommended. Primarily, it's not the rust you should worry about, there most likely always going to be some rust around the edges, that's not at all out of the ordinary. The main problem is that your rotors are most likely grooved, and putting fresh pads on grooved rotors is going to wear the pads faster. Using those grooved brake rotors could also cause your wheels to wobble once you add new brake pads. This is one of those instances where it makes more sense to spend a little more money to eliminate the possibility of a huge headache down the road. It's up to you whether you want to gamble.",

      "answer": "Two of the useful features of this setup (I have no evidence to prove they were the design reasons) are: when braking in a hurry stamping down until you reach the bottom will leave you in first, NOT neutral. This is much safer in many respects than being left with no power in an emergency situation. when starting from neutral, there is no risk of ending up in the wrong gear; 1 kick down leaves you in first gear. I have ridden very old bikes where neutral was the bottom gear, and sometimes the first click up would leave me in second - where I would stall, not being prepared for this.

      "context": "I've just bought a new 2011 plate car. I've heard stories of people 'burning in' engines for the first few hundred or couple thousand miles using methods such as: Not driving above 50 mph. Varying the revs more than usual throughout the entire range. Keeping the revs below 3.5k. I've also heard that modern car engines are broke-in at the factory and the above is complete rubbish. Is 'burn-in' necessary on modern cars? If so, how should I 'burn-in' a new engine?",
      "answer": "You should perform a new car break-in per the manufacturer's instructions. That way, if any warranty issues come up, you've done what they said to do. Generally speaking though (according to the engine builders I've talked to), you do want to vary the RPMs a lot, don't cruise at a steady speed for too long. None of them hold to the drive slow theory, nor the low RPM only idea (some of them do the initial break-in on the dyno with a series of WOT runs through the first few gears). More frequent oil changes are a good idea as a new engine will shed a little bit of metal at first. Usually it's something like initial break-in dyno runs, change oil, drive for 500 miles, change oil, drive for 1000 more miles, change oil, drive for 1500 miles this time, change oil, then onto your normal schedule.",

The combustion of octane follows this reaction: 2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O Or better said, you have two of the hydrocarbon molecules along with 25 oxygen molecules, they swirl together into a mix, the spark plug ignites them, boom, and out the tail pipe comes 16 carbon dioxide molecules and 18 water molecules ... at least in a perfect world. Some cars don't put out exactly that ratio. There may be a little bit of carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbons (C8H18), and/or nitrogen oxide (NO2) coming out of the engine exhaust port along with the CO2 and H2O. In this case, the catalytic convertor's job is to help clean these up so you can get closer to the perfect ratio described above. As described, the water coming out of the tail pipe is a natural occurrence of the combustion process. You will usually see it coming out of the tail pipe when the engine and exhaust system of the vehicle is not completely warmed up. When it does become completely warmed up, you won't see it any more, because it comes out as steam (well, you'll see it in the winter time if it's cold enough, but you get the idea).",

      "question": "Changing Firing Order in a 4 Cylinder Car",
      "context": "Backstory In motorcycling you can get cams that change the firing order and time from a traditional 1,3,4,2. It's was very common in American road racing in the 1990's to hear 4 Cylinder engines that sounded like two cylinder v-twins. The way these guys did it and ultimately popularized this configuration for awhile was to essentially cut the cams in half at the center and rotate one side 180 degrees and weld them back together. This first try wasn't reliable for obvious reasons but you know how racers are and what they will do to get an advantage. This configuration became known as the big bang engine. On a 180 degree crank 1 and 4 would fire at the same time and 2 and 3 would then fire at the same time 180 degrees later in the rotation. This allowed for v-twin low end torque numbers to increase (big debate on that actually) AND since it was a well balanced 4 cylinder engine it would still get those incredible rev's up in the 12,000 plus range. The primary objective for this config is",
      "answer": "Surely, to get a Subaru (or any true boxer engine) to run in this kind of configuration is relatively easy. Bear in mind that you are talking about an engine with two horizontally opposed cylinder heads and a four stroke so for each revolution of the camshaft, there are two revolutions of the crankshaft. Each piston hits it's \"top\" of it's travel twice, once after it's compression stroke and once after it's exhaust stroke. In usual four stroke applications, one piston will be on it's compression stoke, one on it's combustion stroke, one on it's exhaust stroke and one on it's inlet stroke. Cam timing events are set so that the exhaust valve is open during the exhaust stroke and the inlet valve is open on the inlet stroke. During combustion and compression, they're both closed. With me so far? Now, look at an engine like the Alfa Romeo boxer engine and you'll notice that it has two timing belts. Imagine what would happen if the timing belt was fitted incorrectly such that the timing marks on just one bank of the engine (cam wheels) were 180 degrees away from where they should be. The effect would be that bank one and bank two would now be on their compression or whatever strokes at the self same time. Of course there is the slight issue that the spark plug would now be firing 180 degrees out of step with bank two. However, imagine you could connect the spark plugs from cylinder three to that of cylinder two and that of cylinder four to cylinder one. You'd now have two cylinders on firing their plugs at the same time. If you had a carburettor engine, you can stop now as you've achieved your goal. For fuel injected engines, you'd have to tie the firing of the injector up across the two cylinder banks too. However, this wouldn't be a massive undertaking either as all you would need to do is tie the bank that's 180 degrees out to the injector event of the bank that is timed correctly. All of a sudden, you've got an engine that behaves as your described. Real world impleme",

      "context": "I am old enough to have had about four transmission failures spaced over about 40 years and at no time did any mechanic ever offer to “fix” it; the only diagnosis has been a complete rebuild. This is not what happens to any other part of the car. There are many potential repairs to the engine. Various individual parts can be replaced and/or repaired and even the engine itself can be tinkered with to an amazing extent without ever costing anywhere close to $2500. I’ve even heard of having engines rebuilt for less than that. Not transmissions though; only a rebuild. I’ve asked every mechanic I’ve ever used why and I’ve gotten many different answers – they usually involve something about the transmission being so hard to get to that by the time you’ve hoisted the engine out of the way or done whatever else, you’ve spent enough labor to make it feasible to just rebuild the whole thing. But this doesn’t really ring true for some reason. I can’t see why a manufacturer can’t design some acces",
      "answer": "This is one of those things which are easier said than done. To start with, let me show you a picture of a four speed transmission which has been blown apart: All of those hundreds of parts go through the front end of the transmission. If a single part is bad (which it usually is not the case), you have to pull all of this apart in order to diagnose and repair. Like the mechanic you talked to said, it doesn't make sense to replace just the part which is bad while you have it all apart. The parts are pretty much the cheap part of the rebuild (or fix). Why not just make it a brand new transmission through the rebuild process. You could replace the single part, at a cost difference of a couple hundred dollars, only to have it go bad again in the not too distant future when another part goes bad which wasn't replaced. In most cases when a transmission needs repaired, it is one or more of the soft parts which have gone bad. These include the band(s) and clutches. Usually the hard parts, like the gears, do not go bad and are reused after a thorough cleaning and inspection. You also have to consider, the transmission is very susceptible to debris. When these soft part start letting go, it can put a lot of debris through the transmission which the filter cannot keep up with. When the debris starts going around, it will damage other soft parts in the process. Soft parts also tend to wear at about the same pace (within the same group). So, not just one clutch in the clutch pack will go bad, but the entire group of them will go bad. You aren't going to replace just one clutch, you have to replace all of them. One last thing to consider here is that they sell the transmission parts as a kit (with a few exceptions). You aren't just going to buy single parts. By parts in this instance I'm talking about the soft parts ... you can usually buy hard parts separately. There is no other way, with current transmission design, for you to get at any of the parts inside the transmission ..",

Same engine, lower (peak) power output in the Sprinter than in the E-class. The same hardware (and thus the same cost), yet they 'artificially' lower the power output and thus the specs they can use to sell the product. Does it have to do with using the same engine for different purposes? With a van you probably want a different power and torque curve than with a sedan. In the example I gave, that seems to be the case, with the van reaching top power and top torque at a lower rpm than the sedan. Or are there other reasons (fiscal, strategic,...) that lead to these decisions? Using the same example, in Belgium the engine was detuned whereas in other countries it was not (both for the same cars), as can be seen in the Wikipedia page. I live in Belgium but I have no idea why they would have done this for Belgium specifically. In this case, the only differenc",
      "answer": "I'd be tempted to restate the question as \"How do vehicle manufacturers decide what to tune for?\" For the question as asked, there are a lot of possible reasons, and probably no way to know in a specific case unless somebody involved speaks up, but in general: To match the engine to a specific use case (as you suggested here). To find a balance between performance, durability, and marketing needs (detune in Sprinter to improve reliability, tune in E-class for marketing/performance). To fit into a particular regulatory class (in the US, for example regulations change with the load capacity of a vehicle). To meet insurance requirements (horsepower limits for example). To balance \"fleet\" requirements (another example from the US, makers are rewarded/penalized on maker's overall averages for fuel consumption and maybe for emissions as well, so tuning may get tweaked to manage this). Maintaining or adjusting a product \"line\" – a maker may want to have a \"logical\" progression of features or performance and so adjust numbers to make this happen, or may be trying to move customers for strategic or economic reasons. For an operator of the vehicle it would seem that, after evaluating the \"good\" reasons for the tuning decisions, there would be no reason not to adjust the tuning to suit the operator's needs.",

      "question": "Why is my car equipped with a battery shutdown timer?",
      "context": "I currently live in Japan where I bought a 1997 Subaru Impreza WRX STi. Since I don't completely speak Japanese, I wasn't able to ask anybody correctly about one thing that the previous owner had installed, which is a small timer under the steering wheel that does, it seems, different things. Here is the pdf I could find on it One of the things it does is to prevent my car from shutting down after I turn off the ignition. I can turn towards me and remove the key, and when I do, nothing happens. However, the timer starts, and after 60 seconds, the engine turns off. There is a button that allows me to turn off the engine before the end of the countdown, and when I disconnect the battery to change something, and reconnect it after, the timer's default behaviour is to not activate itself, and in such case the engine will turn off as soon as I turn the ignition off. My question is, why would somebody want to delay the engine shutdown like this ?",
      "answer": "It is a turbo timer. The theory is that an engine with hot turbocharger shouldn't be immediately turned off. The turbocharger may be damaged because there will be no oil flow. The timer ensures that the turbocharger has managed to cool down enough by idling. Now, do you actually need the turbo timer? Probably not. The turbocharger is hot only after hard driving. Usually, the last few hundred meters of your driving are near a parking area with low speed limits, meaning there is already enough time for the turbo to cool down. If you drive hard and turn the engine immediately off, on the other hand, you may benefit from the turbo timer.",

      "question": "Running with straight water as coolant in the summer. Is it fine?",
      "context": "I grew up flushing the coolant twice yearly. In the Spring, you drain the antifreeze and fill with straight water for the summer. In the Fall, you drain the water and put in a 50/50 antifreeze/water mixture. I have heard (from an auto store clerk) that running just water will cause overheating. The clerk also said that antifreeze prevents corrosion and sediment build up and cleans the coolant system. Despite years of using water in the summer, I have never experienced any problems that were obviously related. Do I need to start using antifreeze, even in the summer?",
      "answer": "I have heard (from an auto store clerk) that running just water will cause overheating. Well, that's not true. Water isn't the cause of overheating. Your coolant mixture (of whatever proportion) and radiator work together to get rid of the heat. If it's not hot, you won't overheat. However, when it is hot, the coolant can only absorb heat up to its boiling point. Here's a super high level summary of a cooling system: The cool coolant is placed in contact with the metal of the hot engine. Heat is transferred from the metal of the engine to the liquid coolant, heating it up. Hot coolant is pumped to the radiator, making room for cooler coolant to move into the engine. Hot coolant is placed in contact with the metal of the cool radiator, cooling it off. Liquid cooling requires the best contact possible between the metal and the liquid for most efficient heat transfer. Problems occur as the coolant approaches it's boiling point: steam bubbles start to form, especially at hot metal surfaces. Each one of those bubbles is a less efficient point of heat transfer. That means less heat leaving the engine, meaning a hotter engine, more spots where bubbles will form, repeating until steam starts coming out of the hood. So, one of your main goals in assembling a useful cooling system is to ensure that the boiling point of the coolant is high in order to prevent high temperature disaster. Water's boiling point is 100 C = 212 F. Straight ethylene glycol's boiling point is at 197.3 C = 387 F. Of course, you shouldn't use straight ethylene glycol in the radiator either for the sake of efficiency. The clerk also said that antifreeze prevents corrosion and sediment build up and cleans the coolant system. That depends on the product. Quite a lot of the coolants on today's market will inhibit corrosion and minimize sediments. Some, like Water Wetter, will actually increase the cooling system's ability to carry away heat.

      "context": "I want to know the SOHC and DOHC configurations. On what factors an engine manufacturer decides to go with SOHC or with DOHC, what should I choose? DOHC or SOHC?",
      "answer": "For those who don't know, SOHC and DOHC refer to the following: SOHC - Single Over Head Cam DOHC - Double Over Head Cam A cam refers to a \"cam shaft\" or the thing which goes bump in the night. The cam has a \"bump\" or \"hump\" in it which actuates the valves which allows air into and exhaust out of the cylinder of the engine at the correct time so the engine will run correctly. As for the configurations themselves, in SOHC configurations, the camshaft is placed on top of the head. Here is an example: The wheel at the right of the picture is what the cam belt rides on. This wheel is attached to the cam itself. The cam, then actuates the rocker arms which you can see are pointing to either side of the head. This is an example of a 3-valve per cylinder head (2-intake and 1-exhaust per cylinder). The 2-valve per cylinder is a much mor prevalent configuration. Here is an example of a DOHC: In this example, you can see there are two separate cam shafts riding atop the head. For DOHC heads, the cams can be tied together with a short chain, then have a separate chain/belt which drives the cams, or can have just a single chain/belt which runs the whole thing. DOHC engines usually have a configuration of 2-intake and 2-exhaust valves per cylinder, but in some cases like the configuration Volkswagen-Audi Group (VAG) uses a five valve per cylinder (3-intake and 2 exhaust). In most cases, the cam directly actuates the valve without the use of a rocker arm (it may or may not have a \"lifter\" between the cam and the valve). The whole purpose of having OHC configurations is to do away with another form of valve actuation, that of pushrods found in the Over Head Valve (OHV), which is found in most American V8 configurations (Ford uses an OHC version for their motors). OHV configurations use a centrally located cam shaft (central to the engine block), and actuates the valves through the use of lifters, pushrods, and rocker arms. The OHC configuration does away with most of this for the r",

      "context": "Two stroke gasoline engine exhaust pipes are shaped strange. They expand into a wide diameter and then shrink down to a very small diameter where the exhaust gasses emerge into the environment. - Why are they shaped in such a strange way? - What is the large expansion in the exhaust pipe for? - Why does the diameter reduce so dramatically at the end?",
      "answer": "There is this nice animation of a 2-stroke engine with an expansion chamber Source It works like this: While moving downwards after ignition, the piston exposes the exhaust opening, and the burned gas streams into the exhaust pipe like a (high pressure) shock wave. Due to the inertia, this gas will create a slight vacuum wave behind it, which helps to suck out more burned gas, but also fresh gas as soon as the intake opening is uncovered. The first cone helps to increase the vacuum: When the gas travels through the pipe with a certain speed, it travels through a certain volume per time. If the cross section is increased and the speed remains the same, the wave travels through a larger volume. This creates more ... uhm... vacuum volume behind the wave. It's a bit hard to explain. OK, now we have fresh gas in the cylinder, but also in the manifold. The shock wave now hits the right cone and gets reflected. I.e. you now have a shock wave running towards the cylinder. It hits the fresh gas right in the moment when the intake opening is covered by the piston, and presses this gas into the cylinder. When the piston covers the exhaust opening, too, the fresh gas already is under some pressure. This way, the exhaust forms some kind of compressor, increasing the volumetric efficiency / power of the motor. The shape of the exhaust is very critical with respect to timing: The length of the pipe between exhaust opening and first cone defines when the amplified vacuum wave reaches the cylinder - it should be there when the intake openings are exposed and fresh gas can be sucked out of them. And the distance to the second cone defines when the reflected shockwave reaches the cylinder. Again: This should happen when the intake is already covered, and the exhaust is not yet. This means the exhaust pipe is designed for a specific RPM, where you get the maximum gain in power. However, the angles of the cones allow to broaden the RPM range where the motor develops its power, at the co",

      "answer": "What is a 5 stroke engine? They tend to consist of only three cylinders rather than the more traditional 4 stroke, 4 cylinder engines that many people are using today. There are two small small high-pressure cylinders and one larger low-pressure cylinder. This video has some good information and animations. Why aren't they using them in vehicles right now? PROS A secondary cylinder provides an additional expansion process enabling extra work to be extracted, which results in better thermodynamic efficiency (which means less thermal energy is wasted, hence the engine efficiency must increase) 5 stroke engines tend to be quite small as the firing (smaller) cylinders can be very highly rated The engine uses 100% conventional technology and so requires no new manufacturing techniques as such Intended to increase engine efficiency Intended to reduce emissions and fuel consumption A few reasons as far as I can tell: CONS Increased manufacturing costs due to the fact that it is not widely adopted, also referred to as the \"early adopter tax\" Not in mass production so it doesn't benefit from economies of scale (lower manufacturing cost per unit when made in higher quantities) It is a requirement to have two camshafts per engine, resulting in higher overheads on a production line Possibly higher cost of materials (much less significant compared to the first two points) Irregularly sized cylinders and cylinder casings, which would cause engineering difficulties and increased costs associated with that More points of failure, resulting in less comprehensive warranties on new cars Is this a new thing or has it been around for a while?

      "question": "Why does the reverse gear in manual transmission cars sound different",
      "context": "When I got a manual transmission car (2003 Kia Rio) I noticed that it makes a winding sound in the reverse gear. Here is an example video that I found that demonstrates the sound. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mi2t_VT6YWg Why do manual transmission cars make this noise in reverse gear? Does it work differently than the forward gears?",
      "answer": "In manual transmissions, the reverse gears use a different type of gear teeth than forward gears. Forward gears are helical gears, which have teeth that are pointed at an angle. When the gears rotate, most of the load is evenly spread due to the angles. Reverse gears are cut into spurs, which don't absorb the load quite so well. As a result, there is more of a whining noise. The reason reverse gears are spurs is because reverse requires an idler gear to prevent accidentally shifting into reverse while moving. This is what is known as the gears not being synchronized, and this is also why you cannot shift into reverse when you're moving. What you may find interesting is that my 1987 Ford F-150 4x4 makes this same sound when moving forward in low 1st gear. The 4 speed granny low first gear is also using this same technology as it's only designed for towing or going up or down really steep hills.

      "question": "We have fuel injection, why not air injection?",
      "context": "I'm finishing studying EFI systems, which set me thinking about induction more generally. We inject fuel from a high-pressure common rail for many good reasons. We're capable of making stratified burn within a cylinder, provided we have full control of the throttle butterfly. We sometimes use exhaust gas recirculation to retard combustion and lower cylinder temperature. Given those scenarios, why don't we add a common rail of high-pressure atmospheric air, and use injectors to introduce air, and exhaust when required, in a similar way to fuel? Surely this would give me an engine that can respond quicker because there's no lag in the inlet airflow, have fewer mechanical parts and potentially reduce emissions by allowing me to control the oxygen content at the catalyst more easily?",
      "answer": "Simple reason: volume. @ 14.7:1 stoich, your input into the cylinder would need to be 14.7x bigger (or push that much more) through a nozzle than you would the fluid which is fuel. You state it would have fewer mechanical parts, but is that true? You'd have to furnish a mechanical method to create the high pressure air as well as introduce it into the system. You'd have to have some type of tank which would hold the high pressure air. Then that \"high pressure\" would need to be in the 3000-5000 psi range at a guess to ensure proper flow. Think of an air compressor which could keep up with the demand you are talking about. Let's say we throw some math in the mix (and assume I'm not just being completely stupid ... though the jury is out on that one): A 2L engine has a swept volume of 2L. If this theoretical engine was running, naturally aspirated and attained an 80% volumetric efficiency (VE), it would be taking in .8L of air every revolution of the crankshaft. The math: 2.0L X .8 = 1.6L - Intake volume for all four cylinders @ 80% VE 1.8L x .5 = .8L - Intake volume for every revolution in a 4 cycle engine 600rpm x .8L = 480L - Amount of air at idle needed to maintain idle speed 6000rpm x .8L = 4800L - Amount of air at redline to maintain fastest engine speed Your system would need to move 4800L of air per minute in order to maintain that engine speed. That's about 170CFM. If you can haul something like this: around on the back of your car, it might be doable. The 170CFM is a figure for the small, lower horsepower end of the equation. What about performance cars where you have three times as much swept volume (6.3L Chevrolet LT1 engine) with a greater VE (~85% at a guess). Those numbers are hugely greater. You'd be tripling the amount of air needed, which means triple the amount you'd be towing behind the vehicle. Yes it could be done, but at what cost? The way air is introduced into the engine now is far more efficient and introduces far more air than you could relia",

      "question": "Static vs. Effective compression: Why does higher effective compression not require higher octane gas?",
      "context": "Background I've been trying to do a lot of research on boost lately because I'm planning on running a moderate turbo setup on my daily/light-duty-autox car in the future. I'm trying to get into the physics of things so that when I do my build, I'm not just slapping parts on and hoping for the best, but instead engineering a motor to work. The question My main question is this. I've been reading this article and while it's deepened my understanding of compression, it leaves me with this question: I know that engines running a higher static compression ratio require higher octane fuels to prevent detonation, so why do motors with higher effective compression ratios not seem to require higher octane fuels? I usually hear about people running turbo setups and simply using regular pump gas and having no trouble, even though the effective compression ratio would be much higher than most naturally aspirated engines. For instance, the setup that I was considering would be a turbocharged Honda ",
      "answer": "tl;dr: They do. It's just harder to tell how much. The longer answer is that they do and that effective compression is failing you as an approximation for actual effects. Think about detonation (AKA premature ignition of the fuel-air mixture). Normally we consider two causes: compression (the change in the space enclosed by the cylinder as the piston moves up and down) and temperature (e.g., measured temperature of the intake air). In reality, there is only temperature. Let's back all the way to the ideal gas law: PV = nRT where P is pressure, V is volume and T is temperature (in degrees Kelvin, remember!) and the rest are interesting constants that aren't germane to this discussion. Compression causes that V value to decrease and P to increase. In an ideal world, that would be the end of it: the compression of the cylinder would be a 100% efficient process without temperature increase. Unfortunately, we live in an actual rather than an ideal world. The best simple model for what's happening in the engine is that it is a system of constant entropy. This means that we are restricted by the heat capacity ratio of the gases in the system. If we use a heat capacity ratio of 1.3 and an example compression ratio of 10:1, we are looking at an approximate doubling in temperature (degrees Kelvin!). In short, compression makes gases hotter. Why is this bad, though? Think of it this way: you have a fixed temperature budget for a certain octane gas. If T gets higher than T_ignition, bang. So, as you point out, you can add an intercooler to the system, reducing the input air temperature. Likewise, you can change the amount that V changes. This increases the amount of temperature increase that your engine can tolerate before detonating. Now, adding a turbo on the intake air compresses the normal atmospheric pressure to something significantly higher, resulting in a change in those other constants that I previously brushed off (check turbo volumetric efficiency for more informatio",

Should I go and get a new battery or wait until the car won't start? Can I test the battery with a simple tester to see if it's still delivering 12 volts?",
      "answer": "Perform an open circuit voltage test with the vehicle off, and battery disconnected: Check the voltage with a DVOM (Digital Volt Ohm Meter) 12.66 = 100% state of charge 12.45 = 75% state of charge 12.24 = 50% state of charge 12.06 = 25% state of charge 11.89 = 0% state of charge 10.45 - 10.65 = bad cell, battery should be replaced If the battery is at or near 100% then go to step #5. If the battery is less than 100% then go to step #2 If the battery is sealed (maintenance free) go to step #5 if not check the electrolyte level, if low add distilled water and go to step #4. If not go to step #3 Hydrometer test, check the specific gravity of each cell, they should all be at 1.265 or more if the battery is in good condition. If all the cells are below 1.225 the go to step #4, the reading from the highest cell should be no more that 0.050 above the lowest cell, if it's more replace the battery you have a weak cell.

Hook up the charger to the battery set the charger to 30 - 40 amps at 3 minutes check the voltage while charging if it's above 15.5 volts replace the battery it will not accept a charge, if below 15.5 volts reduce the setting on the charger to 2 - 10 amp range (less is better, fast charging reduces the overall life of the battery) and continue to charge the battery until the gauge on the battery charger show close to zero amps. Note this could take 8 or more hours depending on the state of charge and condition of the battery. Unhook the charger wait 2 hours for the surface charge to dissipate then go to step #1 Load testing is done with a specialized tester, most of your local parts or battery stores will have one and provide free testing.

      "question": "What causes an engine to burn oil?",
      "context": "What are the different problems that can cause an engine to burn oil and in general how difficult / expensive is each one to repair? How do you diagnose each potential cause? I found this article which describes some of the problems: Why Does My Engine Use Oil I've seen three things so far: Bad Piston Rings Bad PCV Valve Guide Seals Regarding diagnosing oil consumption and smoke the above article says the following: With older vehicles this was typically accompanied with a puff of smoke from the exhaust. With modern vehicles, the catalytic converter usually prevents smoke. Smoke in the exhaust is vaporized by the converter. Unfortunately, this may drastically raise the temperature and damage the converter, over time.",
      "answer": "Towards the diagnosis end of things, there are some general guidelines to follow: If you are seeing smoke coming from your exhaust, what color is the smoke? If it's blue, then it's oil If it's black, it means you are running rich (too much fuel). If it's white, the car may be burning antifreeze or (quite rare) auto-trans fluid. Since it's blue smoke you are seeing, you can know that oil is the problem. What can cause oil smoke? If the smoke only comes at start-up and quickly goes away, it can be valve seals and/or valve guides. This is because while the car sits for extended periods of time, the oil has time to seep past the valve seal and collect on top of the valve (or if the valve is in the open position, it could run past and on top of the piston). When you go to start your car, the oil is then burned, giving the tell tale puff of blue smoke. COST TO FIX: There is moderate cost involved with this, depending on the vehicle/engine. If just the seals, this can be accomplished most of the time with keeping the engine mostly together and replacing the seals. Most of the cost here is labor. If the valve guides, this requires an engine tear down. Your heads will have to be taken apart and new guides installed. There is a lot more labor here and a bit more in parts. If you see smoke as you are decelerating, this too is a possible sign of valve seals and/or valve guides. This is because as you decelerate, there is a large vacuum build up within the intake tract. There is enough vacuum to pull oil past the valve seal if it's worn. COST TO FIX: Same as above. If you see smoke while accelerating, this is a sign your oil control rings are worn. These are the bottom rings used in the ring pack. When they are worn (or the cylinders are worn past tolerance), oil can flow past the rings as the piston travels down the cylinder. The oil control rings normally will scrape the cylinder of the oil, pushing it back down into the crankcase. COST TO FIX: Their fix is quite expensive, as",

      "context": "I was recently in the lucky position to obtain an (almost brand new) Alfa Romeo MiTo, Progression. Like many new cars coming out these days, it has \"Start & Stop\" technology that turns the engine off when the car is stationary and is put in neutral and the clutch is released. When putting down the clutch again the engine fires back up. My question then is this: a) Is start-stop technology bad for my engine in any way? b) What impact might start-stop have on my battery? I.e. won't it deteriorate battery life with the constant turning on and off? (The radio, fans and lights remain on whilst in \"stop\"-mode, but not things like the aircon.) c) Will this technology really benefit me that much with regards to fuel-consumption?

      "answer": "I would imagine that this sort of technology would lead to increased wear on your starter motor, as it is being used far more than it would normally be, however I would hope that they would have anticipated this and designed the starter to be more robust than a traditional one. The battery should be able to cope with it fine all the time it is in good condition. Batteries do, however, deteriorate over time, with a usual life of around 8-10 years at most. I suspect that as your battery starts to deteriorate, it won't be able to cope as well with the increased drain, leading to the car failing to re-start with traditional flat-battery symptoms. How well the electronics cope with this remains to be seen! As to your third question, I doubt it will help much at all. Getting an engine started needs quite a lot of energy (hence the big chunky battery), and the only way to get that energy is to burn fuel, through your alternator sapping power as it recharges the battery. I don't know the exact figures, but I suspect you'd have to have the engine off for a fair while to save enough fuel to offset the cost of starting it again.",

      "context": "I'm shopping for a new car battery for a 1998 Subaru Outback (2.5l). For the physical dimensions, the battery has to match. But I see some variance in capacity (Ah) rating, and in price too, of course. The intuition goes, as usual, \"higher is better\". The obvious advantage--if I replace my current 55Ah battery with 60Ah one, I'll be able to, say, play music with the engine off for longer, and still be able to start the car. Are there disadvantages of higher capacity though? Also, apart from capacity, which, if any, of the other characteristics (CA, CCA, HCA, RCM etc.) make significant difference in practice and should be paid attention to?",
      "answer": "In most cases, the stock-size battery is correct, and that's what you should stick with. A smaller battery is likely to fail you sooner, unless you live somewhere without a winter (Hilo?). A larger battery is an extra expense, extra toxins, extra weight, and won't give you dramatically longer life. CCA (cold cranking amps) is the main thing to pay attention to. This is a measure of how much current the battery can provide at 0 deg F, as @Pangea points out. Batteries work better when they are warm, so the colder it gets, the less current it can provide. Starting an engine requires a lot of current, over a very short time. Meanwhile, cold engines are harder to start, requiring more power to get them going. As batteries age, their internal resistance increases, reducing CCA. Total capacity decreases at the same time. This is why a newer battery can start your car in any weather, even if you leave the headlights on overnight, while an old battery might only start the car when fully charged, in good weather. Starter batteries are optimized for short-duration, high-current draws, followed immediately by recharging. They are built with thinner plates with more surface area, which speeds up the chemical reactions that release the energy. If you draw them down to 1/2 charge, and then leave them like that for a while, hard crystals will form on the plates, which won't re-desolve easily on recharging. That reduces capacity and CCA over time. So, keep your starter battery fully charged, and avoid dropping below 80% during non-starter usage. (Deep-cycle batteries, like on golf carts, fork lifts, some boats, some RVs are able to tolerate being discharged deeper and left that way longer than starter batteries, but they really don't like a high-current draw like for starting an engine. Best to draw on them gently, and never below 50% if you can help it.) So, a regular car battery is not a good device for running appliances for a long time, without the engine running.

The long (still simplified) answer: Does the accelerator control and ensure gas is flowing through the engine? The harder I press, the more gas flows in and the faster is the engine RPM. Is my mental model correct? Also, if this is the case, does it mean unless I step on the accelerator, no gas flows in and the engine does not spin (unless it was spinning, because of inertia)? Generally, yes, but there are other factors that affect the amount of fuel allowed in the engine: Idle. When the engine is turned on, some fuel is allowed in the engine even with the accelerator pedal fully released. This is why automatic cars inch forward when the transmission is in \"D\" position. You need to apply brakes to prevent this. This is also how e.g. steering assistance or air conditioning are powered. The actual amount of fuel depends also on the engine RPM at the moment. Other, less important factors also impact the engine fuel consumption/power. While driving at, suppose 50kmph, suppose I take my foot off the accelerator, and neither do I press the brake. Does it mean the engine will still spin for sometime (because of inertia) and the car will move some distance (may be even a few miles) before eventually coming to a halt? Is it like when I stop pedaling when riding a bicycle? Mostly. An automatic car will not, in fact, completely come to a halt on a level road - see about the \"idle mode\" above. Slopes can alter this behavior. Uphill, the idle engine power may not be enough to creep the car forward. Downhill, the car can gradually accelerate all the way to its designed maximum speed (and even more) with no action on the accelerator pedal. It is up to the driver to apply brakes and common sense. What happens if I press both the accelerator and foot brake together? As one tries to move the car, and another resists, will some parts internally grind against each other, eventual",

      "question": "What actually happens when there is way too much oil in a car engine?",
      "context": "I saw the answers to a question I posted recently highlighting the disadvantages of having too little oil in an engine, but that got me wondering what if the complete opposite were to occur! I know that having an excess amount of oil in the engine is a terrible idea, but I don't actually know why. It seems to me like the excess oil would eliminate at least some of the disadvantages to not having enough oil (like for example the parts would not rub and create friction because there would be plenty of lubrication). Due to this, I am guessing that having too much oil would have very different disadvantages to not having enough oil. If we imagine that for whatever reason, the engine was full of oil (and I mean literally full to the brim, you can't fit any more in it unless you pour it all over the engine bay): What are the disadvantages to having way too much oil in the engine? How do the disadvantages differ from those that occur from not having enough oil? Would the engine last longer th",
      "answer": "With way too much engine oil in the engine, the problem is that the crankshaft can hit the oil in the bottom of the crankcase when the engine is running. Since the crankshaft is spinning fast, even at idle, each time it slaps the surface of the oil, it will create some bubbles in the oil as the air just behind the spinning crankshaft lobe gets dragged under the surface of the oil. It doesn't take long to get a whole lot of bubbles and the engine oil becomes all frothy and full of bubbles. Since all oil pumps are designed to pump liquid rather than (compressible) gas, even though the pump is still operating, it's literally sucking air instead of pumping vital engine oil. The net effect is that the oil doesn't get delivered to the places it's supposed to go, so a gross excess of engine oil can kill your engine by the exact same cause as not having enough engine oil. With that said, if you put in, say, a quart too much, it's probably not going to be a problem (depending on the type and capacity of the engine). If you put twice as much in (I've heard of people doing this because they forgot that they already replaced the oil and do it again!) it's almost certainly going to kill the engine unless corrected before the engine runs for very long.",

      "context": "I'm trying to disassemble the exhaust system on a 2000-2003 Nissan Maxima and I'm having trouble removing one last bolt. It's got a 14mm head and its just plain STUCK. I've tried soaking it overnight with PB Blaster, then the next morning I tried removing it with a 2ft long breaker bar + a 2ft extension. After making absolutely positive I was trying to turn it the proper direction, I braced myself by putting both feet on a framerail and pushing with all my strength. And then, my socket shattered into a billion pieces. Bolt: 1 Me:0.",
      "answer": "My general rule for exhaust bolts/nuts is to order new ones with the part you are replacing, knowing full well that there is a good chance you'll destroy the ones you are removing. Better to be prepared ahead of time than to be stuck waiting for new parts from another country after you've disassembled everything. Personally, I have a rule of ordering every bolt and nut that is attached to the exhaust member I'll be replacing. Even if there isn't much rust, I never know when a bolt will snap. First task is to let the exhaust completely cool. It's possible that the parts are made of different types of metal which expand and contract at different rates. Now, how to get the rusted bolts off: Use an impact wrench. Sometimes the vibration and hammering action works better to \"knock\" a bolt loose, compared to wrench/breaker bar. In my experience, this is the first tool of choice for 95% of techs working on an exhaust system. Use a big breaker bar. 2 ft is okay, 4 ft is more like it. Use high quality, name brand tools that won't flex or shatter on you (or at least give you free replacements when they do shatter). The flexing is important. If the cheap breaker bar is flexing instead of transferring the full torque, you may as well not have it. Sometimes there is just too much material rusted off of the bolt for either of the above to work. Or one of the above techniques may round out the bolt before it comes out. In this case, the bolt needs to be destroyed so you can move on with life. Some options are: Die grinder with appropriate wheel. Hacksaw / airsaw. Air hammer with chisel bit. In extreme cases, torch. As always, use high temperature anti-seize when putting in the new bolts. They will go in easier, and the next person down the road will thank you. Safety Note: All of the above methods assume you know the safety procedures for the tool. Of particular importance is having the vehicle properly raised on the car lift. Some of these methods involve violently pulling stuff ",

Some problems that this can cause is destroy the catalytic converter and in petrol engines water can cause damage to spark plugs. And in diesel cars I thought you needed a special exhaust if you want to drive with the engine underwater. And I also saw a video about a car that had its engine destroyed. How much of this is true? And how do those 4 wheel drive cars drive with their engines submerged in muddy water ? I have myself driven a Toyota yaris through water as high as the top of its wheels and nothing happened although I did keep the engine on high revolutions. What is the recommended thing to do if you need to pass through an area that's been flooded? (Ofcourse the answer will depend on the car) I have seen many videos and pictures of cars driving through deep water and here are two examples: 1. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ednZi2T-TsA&t=58s 2. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=LC5ld79joIA",
      "answer": "The term you're looking for is Wading Depth which is specified by the manufacturer. They may surprise you, and its info you should know about your vehicle. Its in your manual, or search it online. Examples Jeeps say 500mm, and some models go to 700mm Mercedes GLC SUV has a wading depth of just 300mm Landrover Discovery (not the more compact Discovery Sport) has a wading depth of 900mm - this is the depth where the rear starts to float. A Nissan Leaf has a colossal 700mm maximum wading depth - yes an electric car. A Nissan Fairlady has an air intake behind the headlights, so its only able to go around 2 inches of water, and that assumes flat still water. The safest assumption for any car is DON'T drive through water. Next is \"no deeper than the sills on the car. For a car-based SUV its no more than a car. For a proper 4WD then \"center of the wheel's axle\" is a safe minimum. All this assumes an unmodified vehicle. Discussing the two videos: The first shows a pair of relatively unmodified utes (pickup trucks) attempting to drive upstream against water flow. They are not in the center of the river, so are likely on a slightly shallower ledge. The vehicle nearest camera is stuck because its traction is equal to the pressure of the oncoming water, which is why it can't make headway. The passengers are bouncing to try and increase the traction. The Isuzu DMAX ute has a fresh air intake right over the wheel arch nearest the camera. Its more at risk from flooding the alternator, which is slightly lower. These two vehicles are at about their maximum depth for water crossing. RISKS: Thankfully they're playing in the shallows - the end of the recording shows a small protrusion upstream, shielding them from the worst of the river's flow. Had they tried to cross the river at this ford, it would have ended up with vehicles floating downstream out of control. Notice the nearer vehicle gets out by moving right, into a shallower area and then gets traction. The further vehicle ends u",

      "question": "How slow ( not zero) can a car engine run without hurting engine and saving on fuel",
      "context": "New cars have stop-start system (even though this has been available for a long time). My question is: why are car companies emphasizing shutting the engine down at a traffic light, rather than making the engine run at close to zero RPM (but certainly not zero) at idle speed using the car's ECU? My idea is that the car engine keeps running, and when the driver releases the gas pedal, the engine returns to a very low idle speed. In the manufacturer's current scenario, when the engine shuts down, the battery power is used and can put strain/stress on the battery. I see cars have RPM meter that shows rotations-per-minute in thousands. Can't engine just run at 100 RPM, drawing very much less gas/petrol? Others have similar concerns. And why don't companies make cars that have an engine that can stop just short of firing a cylinder?",
      "answer": "The oil problem You can run any engine speed you want as long as you keep the oil pressure up. Because of the impossibility of getting a roller bearing down a crankshaft, engine bearings are \"plain bearings\" with polished steel floating above babbitt (a soft metal). The oil pressure makes the bearings \"float\", so the dynamic forces of pistons being thrown to and fro is transferred by the oil, not hard steel-on-babbitt contact. The babbitt is only there for coldstarts and very occasional unintended bottoming-out. Frequent bottoming-out will destroy the bearings (it sounds a bit like dieseling). So you must keep oil pressure high enough to float the bearings. Super slow idling doesn't work on common off-the-shelf engines because they have a simple positive-displacement oil pump, whose flow is coarsely proportional to RPM. This means the lower the RPM, the less oil pressure available for \"floating\" the bearings. At very low speeds, there's not enough flow to keep up oil pressure, and you can bottom out bearings - especially at heavy throttle. So, to idle at 100 RPM, you need to solve the oil problem. Large museum engines have an electric auxiliary oil pump, specifically to pre-fill the oil pressure lines (which have leaked back, and are now empty) so you get pressure immediately on engine start. But that is not enough to pressurize - for that, you need a much bigger pump. But it only needs to run at sub-idle. That pump is going to be a problem. At too low a speed, it becomes an energy net loss, because you're spending more energy running the pump than the engine gives you. Which defeats the purpose of running the engine. The power pulse problem Let's say you solve the oil problem. Experience is that engine RPM must be 500-900 RPM for power pulses to average out enough not to annoy customers. You also don't want to hit a resonance frequency of engine, mounts, suspension or road structure (or airbag sensors, ha!) or it will tear them apart. Others talk about this at leng",

      "answer": "letting the car idle isn't good for the car, especially with the AC on. What you're basically accomplishing is aiding in the car wearing without racking up any miles. With the cylinders firing, you are using several electrical components, putting some small amount of stress on the belts, etc. If you've ever seen ads for cars claiming high mileage but declaring that they are \"highway miles\" the claim they're attempting to make is that they aren't doing city driving with the vehicle (unnecessary idling and as such effectively putting miles on the engine but not the odometer). Whenever the engine is running, you are slowly wearing out some of the components of the vehicle. Doing this for a few minutes here or there doesn't make for a huge difference, but 30-40 minutes at a time would be more than equal to the amount of time you'd spend idling at lights/in traffic in a major city during a 1+hour commute.

      "question": "What are the Advantages &amp; Disadvantages of a Boxer engine?",
      "context": "I know that boxer engines are those which have pistons moving in the opposite direction. Also the fact that since they sit low, the center of gravity is lower which causes better handling. Why don't mainstream manufacturers use the Boxer configuration (sans Subaru and the BR-Z cars; also not including the VW Beetle and the Tata Nano)? What are the disadvantages?",
      "answer": "Like V configuration piston engines , boxer or flat configuration engines can be made approximately half the length of a straight configuration engines. Compared to V engines boxers are not as tall, offering the ability to position mass lower in the vehicle's chassis, but are wider. All boxer engines feature low primary vibration as pairs of pistons are opposed and move in a way to cancel out each other's momentum. Like Vs boxers are more complex that straight engines, having 2 cylinder heads with associated head gaskets, exhaust manifolds etc., and double the number of camshafts, more complex camshaft chains or belts and more complex cooling. Compared to Vs, boxer engines have a more complex crankshaft as they have a crank throw for each connecting rod. True V's have pairs of rods sharing each crank throw. The probable reason boxer or flat configurations are not used very often in modern cars is because a straight or V engines are almost always a better choice. Many cars are now front wheel drive which work best with a compact, transversely mounted engine. A straight-4 or a V6 are much more suitable that a flat-4 or flat-6 in this configuration. Longitudinal mounted engines are preferred for front-engine, rear wheel drive, the boxer engine's lower mass probably does not provide enough advantage over the simpler straight-4 or V6. Where boxer's really do seem to work is in air-cooled rear-engined cars (e.g., the VW Type-1 and Porsche 911) where width is less of a concern, the engine must be a short as possible to avoid a large mass behind the rear axle, and the banks of cylinders are easier to cool as they are more widely spaced from each other. With regards to the modern Subaru layout, which originally featured 4-cylinder engines and all wheel drive, a longitudinal mounted boxer makes sense. To accommodate front wheel drive-shafts the engine must be placed in front of the front axle line, and the short, low boxer engine has advantages. (Compare this with the origina",

      "context": "Last week I was driving a motorcycle. When I stopped at a traffic light I noticed the rear suspension dropped a little when I released the rear brake. Later I noticed my car did the same thing. When you suddenly stop, but not release the brake the suspension appears to be locked (\"frozen\") (See below image). When you do release the brake, the cars suspension appears to drop down to its resting position. But why is this? As far as I know parts of the brakes (brake rotors, calipers, drums and shoes) are not connected to the moving suspension parts such as the damper spring, damper and stabilizer. Also the suspension does not require the wheels to move in order to move. You can just as easily bounce the suspension while the car is parked. Can someone explain to me how this works?",
      "answer": "I made a crude sketch illustrating the relevant points of the shown image. Brakes engaged: The center of gravity is above ground, the brakes \"try\" to slow down the car, the car itself \"wants\" to move further forward. The front \"sinks\", compressing the front struts (orange). The rear \"raises\", thereby allowing the rear suspension (blue) to \"open\". As a consequence the distance between front and rear wheels (red) gets smaller (teal line). When the car is now at a complete stop: The applied brakes keep the wheels from turning, thereby the distance between the wheels remains the same. This is now important: The contact points of the wheels, combined with the pivot (purple circle) of the rear suspension form a triangle (purple lines). A triangle with fixed lengths allows no movement. Thereby the rear stays raised. The front wheels have only a small effect as they have a pure vertical freedom, excluding every horizontal movement. Brakes released The relaxed brakes allow the wheels to roll freely. The \"blocking\" triangle now gets \"deactivated\" as the distance between the wheels is now variable. The now opened wheels allow the rear suspension (blue lever) to \"close\" as the rear of car still weights down on the rear wheels through the springs.",

I've noticed that if the jumper cables are removed a second or two after the car has started, it dies. To avoid that, we rev the engine to charge the battery. Why is that? Why does the engine need the battery to keep running? Should it not be able to run without it after the engine has started firing?",
      "answer": "It's because of a couple things: The battery is very dead and the alternator cannot put out enough power at idle RPMs to run the whole system and charge a battery. This leads to a lack of power which may kill one or more systems most likely the spark \"ignition\" system since this takes the most power and is necessary to run the car. In Fact you can remove the battery all together making sure the positive cable is insulated and run the car that way too. At Least once you get it started. Andre Borie has a good point. removing the battery can potentially cause damage to some of the more delicate electronics in the car. This is due to the battery acting like a big capacitor smoothing out some of the larger spikes in the electrical system. These spikes can originate from many different sources: the alternator, power surges from the coil packs, or even a wire crossing something like a spark plug wire causing some induction. kmarsh below has a good point here is a video on how a self starting alternator works and if the car has been sitting too long the alternator can go flat too.

      "question": "Why do we need to cool air after it leaves a turbocharger?",
      "context": "When we are using a turbocharger to compress the incoming air, the air gets hotter. Usually this hot air is cooled by using an intercooler before it's passed to the engine. What is the reason behind cooling this air? Why can't we pass it as hot air, since inside the engine the air will be compressed which will heat it up anyway?",
      "answer": "tl;dr To combat detonation (in SI engines) To increase power/efficiency Details There are a few important factors at play here. Engine detonation is a real concern for SI engines A spark-ignition engine is more likely to experience premature ignition (aka knocking or detonation) with hotter air. In fact, the calculations in the example below can show that this is the primary reason why intercooling is such a Good Idea. Hot air rises, cold air sinks In physics-speak, hot air is less dense than cold air. This means that the volume occupied by 1 kg of hot air is greater than the volume occupied by 1 kg of cold air. The internal combustion engine is a volumetric device What this implies is that every time the engine turns over and completes a cycle, the volume of air that is admitted into the combustion chamber(s) is fixed. Power depends on mass, not volume The power developed by the engine is proportional to the mass of air admitted into the combustion chamber and not its volume. More air molecules = more bang. The reason why turbochargers (or any other forced-induction devices) are utilized is to increase the power and/or efficiency of the IC engine. At combustion chamber level, this is achieved by increasing the amount of air molecules present during combustion. The turbocharger achieves this by pressurizing the incoming air. An unwanted by-product of this compression process is that the outgoing air is hot and less dense. If this hot air is fed to the combustion chamber as-is, the likelihood of engine detonation is greater. By cooling the air via an intercooler, engine operation being safer since engine knock is reduced. As an added bonus the air becomes slightly denser, enabling more air molecules to be present during combustion. Bonus Example This is one of those questions where numbers can speak louder than words: Forums indicate that a stock Mitsubishi Evo X is capable of generating 22 psi boost at mid-range RPM. At sea level, the turbo inlet conditions are as f",

      "question": "When is an engine flush a good idea?",
      "context": "I have heard really mixed opinions about the necessity of engine flushes. My quick research suggested that manufactures do not recommend doing them. In addition, I have heard of extreme cases of blown engines after engine flushes. My mechanic performed an engine flush on my old car and so far, it seems to be ok. Is it safe? Is it necessary? What are the pros and cons of doing it?",
      "answer": "An engine flush is basically the process in which a mechanic puts chemicals in the engine oil to break down sludge or carbon deposits from old oil. The difficulty with it is that it can break down sludge that had formed over rubber seals and is actually serving as a secondary engine seal. Furthermore, if your engine has had regular engine oil changes at the specified times, a flush should be totally unnecessary. If you do have serious sludge build-ups, it could be the best route to take; but you're taking it at a risk. If the sludge is actually protecting the rubber gaskets, you may have a bigger job on your hands replacing them.",

      "question": "Is starting your car with the A/C on bad?",
      "context": "I was always yelled at by my father when I was first starting to drive when I left the A/C on when I turned off the car, and then later turned it back on, with the reasoning that I was ruining / decreasing the life of my engine. Is this true? (I currently drive an '03 Chevy S10, if that matters, though I'm more interested in a general answer).",
      "answer": "Not at all. You may be in some small way reducing the life of your starter, but this would be pretty negligible. When you start with the A/C switch on, you will be starting with the A/C Compressor clutch engaged, which means the starter must turn both the engine and the compressor; altogether a rather trivial amount of force in comparison to the force needed to spin the motor with the compressor clutched disengaged. Once you've gotten it started, the compressor would be robbing some non-zero percentage of the motor's power, just as the alternator and power steering pump would. One could argue perhaps for some reduction in fuel economy during the startup process, but hey you've got a cold car to get into. To put this in perspective, think of hotter climates like Arizona. Most cars have remote starters, and the leave their A/C on full time so that when they start their cars from inside their house, the cabin is a reasonable temperatures. I'm also convinced that engines in those climates last much longer than those from colder ones, due to less extreme temperature transitions.",

      "answer": "A full synthetic oil, as the name states, is \"synthesized\". By that, they mean it is made in a lab, it is a manufactured product. Organic (Dino) oil is a product of nature. So the big difference is the environment in which the oil is made in. The main selling point on synthetic over organic is because it is manufactured, it is made in a controlled environment. That means far less impurities and a more consistent product. Organic oil will be influenced by what it was made from, what was in the ground where it was extracted from, etc. Another way to think about it is synthetic is an additive process. They start with nothing and add in the components they want until they get the end product. Organic oil is a reductive process, they start with an unrefined product and filter out all the stuff they don't want until they have what they want left.",

Otherwise a person could go mad trying to figure out which repairs/replacements should reset the clock. (Obviously not tires or wheels, but wheel bearings? Axles/driveshaft? Transmission/differential? etc...) It also makes sense when you think about the disconnect between the number of hours an engine has run vs. the distance it's traveled. Work trucks, limousines and police cars all can spend a significant amount of their life just idling, and that's not reflected in an odometer reading because the chassis never went anywhere in that time.",

      "context": "When you come to a stop with a manual transmission you have to push the clutch in or take it out of gear to keep the engine from stalling out. What keeps the engine from stalling in an automatic transmission. Even when I rev the engine while holding the brake the engine won't stall out, I can tell the car is in gear because it's trying to move forward but the engine stays running. If I tried this with a manual transmission the engine would stall",
      "answer": "The reason that an automatic doesn't stall out while \"in gear\" and at a stop, while a manual transmission does, is that automatic transmissions use a hydraulic torque converter to connect the engine to the transmission, while manual transmissions use a friction clutch. These two systems do a similar job in a very different way. A torque converter uses fluid to transfer the power, and so it can \"slip,\" effectively disengaging the engine from the drive wheels at low speeds. When you come to a complete stop in an automatic transmission car, the torque converter starts slipping, allowing the engine to keep turning even though the wheels have stopped. The only way to get the friction clutch of a manual transmission to slip is to depress the clutch pedal. If you come to a stop in a manual transmission car without depressing the clutch pedal, the engine stops turning when the wheels stop turning, and the car stalls. See Wikipedia's articles on torque converters and clutches for a more thorough treatment.",

      "question": "proper oil for 1940&#39;s era aluminum ford engine",
      "context": "I would like to know the proper oil to use in a Ford GAA engine from around 1945. Could be as late as 1958. From a series of photos of a GAA being restored on Flickr. Currently this engine has all the original seals and gaskets and showed no signs of leaking when I got it. I do know the bearings are silver babbitted and the block, heads, and covers are aluminum. It has brass cam gears and a gearbox upfront to run the magnetos water pump PTO shafts and cam drive shafts. I am thinking this is going to be a pretty heavy oil maybe a straight 50 weight or something but not sure. I have not found any parts list that has a part number specifically for this engines oil. I do have a copy of the GAA / GAF / GAN service manual but any other documentation would be great.",
      "answer": "Per @Eric Urban's suggestion, I found the Technical Manual for the M4A3 tank published in 1942. That tank did use the aluminum Ford GAA 18L V8 engine which produces 500 hp at 2600 RPM! It says: Capacity: 32 Quarts Above 32°: SAE 30 32° to 10°: SAE 30 or 10 10° to -10°: SAE 10 Below -10° : Not Listed Replace the oil every 50 hours or 500 miles on dirt roads or 1000 miles on paved roads. (These are miles in a tank.) Clean the oil filter every 1000 miles. I believe @user23543 has a point that oil formulations have changed over the years. In 1942, the SAE J300 standard was much different. It was only concerned with one viscosity and tested that in a much different way than today. They used a different test apparatus and different temperatures. Some say, \"the minimum standards for each grade have only become more demanding [over the years]\". That's a good general rule, but it's not that simple. SAE J300 started out measuring just one viscosity of the oil with a \"crude\" apparatus. Nowadays, SAE J300 prescribes the grades by listing the viscosity under several different conditions. Today's oils are probably overall better than back then, but since we do not know the other viscosity numbers from back then, we cannot make a full comparison. I have been unable to find the revision year of SAE J300 that was applicable in 1942. I have also been unable to obtain a copy of the original SAE J300 standard published in 1911. The original SAE J300 compared all oils the same; it did not break \"oils\" up into the various categories we have today. Illustrative points: Prior to 1947, oil was not divided into Regular Type (mineral oil), Premium Type, and Heavy-Duty Type (contains detergents). (source) Prior to 1952, oil was not divided into gasoline and diesel engine categories. Even then, that was part of the API standard, not SAE J300. (source) In 1952, SAE added the winter (\"W\") grade. (source) The viscosity of SAE 30 back then and the viscosity of SAE 30 now are similar, but not identi",

      "question": "Aluminium engine vs Cast Iron engine",
      "context": "What is the advantage that the aluminium engines provide over the cast iron engine apart from the fact of rusting and weight reduction. Manufacturers like to boast about their all new aluminium engines does this really mean anything to the customer? Should i buy a slightly more powerful cast iron engine or the less powerful aluminium engine?",
      "answer": "You've already stated the main reason for the aluminum blocks which is the weight reduction. It is the same reasoning which has led Ford to produce their F-Series trucks with an aluminum body: weight reduction equates to better fuel economy. Most manufacturers today are using aluminum in various places to reduce the overall weight of the vehicle. As far as rusting goes, this usually isn't an issue on cast iron blocks as it's life is spent under cover. Only when it is left sitting in the elements does it suffer this fate. Since you are reducing weight in the front end of the vehicle, it can in most instances provide a better weight bias as well. For those vehicles which are concerned with centering the weight of the vehicle (ie: Corvette), taking 110 lbs off the front of the car (when they moved to the LS1 engine and variants) helped a lot in this transition (moving the transmission to the rear of the car helped as well). This can provide better cornering attitude and help with over/under steer mannerisms. There are three main advantages (that I can think of) for a cast iron block over an aluminum one: Dimensional Stability: Aluminum grows more during the heating process than does iron. Extra precautions must therefore be built into aluminum blocks so as counteract this condition and prevent issues. No Cylinder Liners: If you ever want to rebuild an aluminum block where the cylinder liners are toast, they must be replaced. This is a large machining expense in comparison to having to just bore the cylinders in a cast iron block. Cost: Cast iron has been used in industry for many years and is fairly easy to produce. Aluminum, on the other hand, costs a lot more to refine from bauxite ore. Just in materials alone, the cost is greater. Then look at the cost for the cylinder liners and special casting processes which must be employed to get the aluminum block correct and the cost goes even higher. There is some trade-off, however, in the heating process (doesn't take as m",

The larger capacitors were actually in place of a worn out battery. Both capacitor packs were giving him the needed voltage to start his vehicle and appear to be working quite fine. My questions are: How can a capacitor work in place of a car battery? How does a capacitor work in the first place? Are there any modifications you have to do in order to use a capacitor instead of a battery? Would there be any benefits to using a capacitor over a battery? It appears in the video the capacitors are charging right back up to 14.1vdc. How long will a capacitor hold it's charge (in general terms - I know this is dependent upon the parasitic drain put on it from the vehicle in the first place)? I guess the better question is, will the capacitor hold enough charge over time to support starting the vehicle?",
      "answer": "Yes its possible to start a car with Ultra capacitors. These caps don't appear to have a cycle life that the traditional lead acid batteries have. The ability of these caps to provide starting current is very good. There are a couple of snags: The caps at present are more pricey than the best lead acid batteries. The caps are strung in series to get the nominal 12V which is fine when you use 6 of them rated at 2.7V each. Don't use them on old cars with a generator and electromechanical regulator because their voltages simply are not accurate by modern standards. It would be wise to include some balancing electronics to keep the voltage on any cap below 2.7V. This is all not too bad so far but this is why I have not done this yet. The ultra cap has brilliant power density but bad energy density compared to the lead acid. It's like comparing strength to endurance. Modern cars that have decent charging systems are likely to have higher sneak currents that occur when the key is off. In other words you would be more likely to find that your car won't start after not being used for a couple of weeks. However charging them fast is easy.",

I think Park is basically neutral, but with a parking pin locks the wheels from moving... so when surface is flat we don't need that pin and using handbrake is enough. What do you think?",
      "answer": "Can we use Neutral (N on the selector) instead of Park (P) when parking on a flat surface? Possibly. Others have delved into the details already, read the other answers. However there is one important point that I have not seen brought up yet. Regardless of the type of transmission, you should have two mechanisms stopping your car from moving while unattended. With an automatic transmission, put the gear selector in Park, and engage the parking brake. With a manual transmission, put the gear selector in first gear (or reverse, whichever is recommended in the owner's manual) and engage the parking brake. The goal here is to have a failsafe: systems can and do fail. Let us say you park in neutral and engage the parking brake. Now if someone cuts the physical cable (parking brake works like a bicycle brake with a steel cable to engage the brakes, and usually only the rear ones) they can roll your car away to a chop shop1, roll it into another car for \"fun,\" whatever they want while you are not around. What if you use only the parking gear but not the parking brake? While rare, transmissions do fail. What if the parts responsible for stopping the transmission from moving cracked and broke? Your car could roll away due to gravity or thieves. Note that even a \"flat surface\" does not mean \"level\" and what appears level might not be. By using both mechanisms together, you mitigate the risk of your vehicle moving without you intending it to. Both systems have to fail, and at roughly the same time. There is a third mechanism for use on hills, which is actually coded into law in some jurisdictions: curbing your car's wheels. What is the mechanical difference between Park and Neutral? Park engages a parking pawl inside the transmission which prevents the transmission output shaft or shafts from moving more than a tiny bit (the little bit of give is why a car might lurch a few inches after parking on an incline). Other than that, park might be equivalent to neutral, or there cou",

When temperature set to maximum cold (\"LO\") and blower set to maximum speed (\"6\" bars), the output air flow is 60°F. I am not expecting a nearly 20°F rise in temperature with the blower going.

      "answer": "Welcome to the wonderful and wacky world of thermodynamics. A volume of air has heat. For example a gallon of air needs a certain amount of cooling to drop from 87 degrees to 42 degrees. An AC evaporator can absorb heat at a constant maximum rate. When the blower is on low and lets say flowing one gallon of air a second, the evaporator is able to drop its temperature from 87 to 42 degrees. Now you turn the blower to high and the flow rate goes up to six gallons a second. The cooling rate of the evaporator has not changed, it is still pulling in a fixed amount of heat. So when the evaporator could cool one gallon to 42 degrees, it now cools six gallons to 60 degrees in the same amount of time.",

      "context": "I have an older engine that is seized. It is a 1953 Desoto Hemi. How can I un-seize it? I have sprayed Sea Foam Deep Creep down the plugs and let sit for weeks. As well as transmission fluid. To no avail, this bad boy won't crack. I have attempted to use a pipe wrench on the pulley, with a 10' solid steel pipe as an extension. It would not move. I suspect using a 20' extension might help the situation. There has to be a systematic approach to get this turning.",
      "answer": "Stop trying to crank it and start beginning to disassemble it. Something is seriously wrong with it and forcing it will only break more stuff that might not already be broken. Especially if you have no idea what caused it to seize in the first place. The only thing more annoying than a seized engine is a seized engine with a sheared off bolt in the nose of the crank. Save yourself the hassle. I would start by disconnecting the crankshaft from the camshaft and seeing if the bottom half can rotate when disconnected from the valvetrain. Looks like you've already done that so on to the next step. If that doesn't work, take off one head, try again, then take off the other. Maybe a valve and a piston hit each other really hard and are wedged together? Next, take off the oil pan and look up the cylinder bores. See anything funny? No? Remove the oil pump and remove the rods from the crank and begin pushing the rods and pistons out the top one by one. See anything funny with the bearings? The pistons? The cylinder walls? When all the rods and pistons are out, off come the main caps, the bearings and the crankshaft. Then you can start inspecting the cylinder walls and the piston skirts. This will tell you why the engine is seized. The rebuild may then commence.",

      "question": "What are the benefits of a dry sump?",
      "context": "I've heard references to dry sumps, usually in reference to racing engines. But more recently I came across an article about a 'supercar' which stated that it had a dry sump. What are the benefits of a dry sump? Could a regular oiling arrangement be upgraded to one?",
      "answer": "You Asked What are the benefits of a dry sump? Simply put a wet sump crankcase has oil sitting in the bottom of the crankcase. It's affected by various forces as the car or motorcycle is driven. At times it is possible, during hard braking or cornering, that the oil pickup is not in oil, resulting in a low or no oil pressure condition that could temporarily leave the engine without good oil pressure for lubrication. IMO this would be rare, even under hard driving, on the street. By viewing the image below you can see how the oil sits at the bottom of the crankcase in a 'pool'. A dry sump engine will have a pickup along the bottom of the crankcase that oil typically will fall into thus scavenging all excess oil. This oil is pumped into an oil tank where another pump will drive oil pressure into the ice. This is primarily for race application and some motorcycles. Rotax has implemented this system with Aprilia. The BMW Dakar Edition on/off road motorcycles have this feature whereas the standard edition of the motorcycle does not. A motorcyclist can ride wheelies for miles, a Baja Desert Racer can jump their truck and drive through long off-camber turns at speed without worrying about loss of oil pressure and engine damage. Answer Dry sump oil delivery ensures oil pressure to the engine in most all conditions and reduces risk regarding low oil pressure to the engine.",

      "question": "What is a rod knock?",
      "context": "What is a rod knock? What causes a rod knock, how bad is a knocking rod, and how can I tell if a rod is knocking?",
      "answer": "To get to basics, the rod (or connecting rod) is the portion of the engine which connects the piston to the crankshaft. Where the rod connects to the crankshaft there is a bearing which separates the rod itself from the crank journal. The bearing is made from a softer material than the rod or the crankshaft. You can see most all of the internal parts of an engine in this exploded view below. The connecting rod is #7, the crank shaft is #16, piston #4, and bearing can be found marked as #8. When an engine is built, there are certain gap tolerances (specific distance measured in .001\") which are built into it, the rod bearing to crankshaft journal being no different. In this case, the tolerance is there to allow a specific amount of oil through from a hole in the crankshaft journal and remain on the bearing surface. Oil films on the bearing and keeps the two parts from touching during normal engine operation. If the clearance gets too big from either wear or deformation, the oil will no longer film correctly and you will get the rod knock. The noise itself occurs due to metal on metal contact between the bearing and the crankshaft journal during the power stroke of the engine cycle. If the situation is really bad it can even be caused by the rod itself contacting the crankshaft journal (where the bearing has become out of place). The most common cause of rod knock is due to a spun bearing (bearing itself actually spins in the end of the rod so it becomes out of position). This usually happens due to rod cap stretch during abusive driving situations. It can also happen due to a lack of lubrication, either because of a lack of oil or because oil is flowing incorrectly. It can also be caused by a combination of any (or all) of the three. A rod knock is a very serious issue with the engine. As you can probably tell from my write-up, it means the engine is no longer functioning correctly. It is the death knell of the engine. Once the rod knock occurs, it will not cure itse",

      "context": "I drive a 2013 Mazda 3, in case that makes any difference to the answer. There seems to be a few discussions on the web which indicate that putting an automatic car into neutral does not significantly improve fuel economy. However, I developed this habit of putting the car into neutral at stop lights, and have been told by a few friends that this is bad for my car's transmission. This answer seems to agree with that assessment, but does not provide any convincing evidence that the wear on the transmission is significant.

      "question": "Why does diesel engine need a warm-up before the start-up?",
      "context": "When starting up, diesel engine needs approximately 5s before turning the key for ignition. Why is this neccessary and what can be damaged if you don't do that?",
      "answer": "Since diesel engines rely on compression to run and not a spark like a gasoline engine, heat is directly involved in the combustion of the diesel in the combustion chamber. The way this occurs is that when the piston comes up it compresses the air which is in the cylinder. This creates heat. When the engine is cold, a lot of this heat gets transferred out of the combustion chamber and into the cylinder head, pistons, and cylinder walls. Since the engine needs this heat to run, it has to get it from somewhere else. When you first turn the ignition on, there are little parts called glow plugs. These heat the combustion chamber and gets them ready so combustion can occur. The five seconds is required to give the glow plugs time to do their thing. If this didn't occur, you could potentially flood the engine with diesel and it would be a really hard time starting it after that. No real damage would occur, but how long it would take to start (if it ever did start) would be forever (well, it would probably seem that way).",

      "context": "A 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee has gone through 3 batteries in the last 3 months. While they have all been replaced by warranties, it'd be nice to get the problem solved permanently. I've tested the alternator, and it's not defective. I'm suspecting it might be a short somewhere in the system. How can I track down if this is a short, and if so, where the short is occuring?",
      "answer": "Standard digital multimeters can measure current and help you identify what in your vehicle is consuming your battery's juice. Get an electrical diagram of your vehicle and try to narrow it down by doing current measurements in the various major paths of flow. When your car is off, no (or only trace) current should be flowing. Every time the path of electricity splits, you'll have to test each to determine which one is drawing the juice. There's no telling how many of these you'll have to check before you reach the problem. This answer of course assumes the juice is being drained while the vehicle is off. I suppose it is possible that it is draining while on also. Either the alternator is bad or it isn't able to produce enough juice to keep up with your vehicle's demand (which probably includes some defective component that is sucking lots of juice). If it keeps running normally, it might be worth checking the leads coming to the battery (while still disconnected) with a meter to ensure it is being fed properly by the alternator. By the way, please do this before doing any more battery exchanges. You are making the price of my next battery go up by taking advantage of the return policy like this.",

I know there are pre-built systems to buy and install in the car but thats not what my question is. For the PC itself I am planning on using a Raspberry Pi(2) with either Debian or Arch Linux. I will create the software for the audio player, navigation and diagnose by myself. Some time ago a friend of mine told me that a car PC isn't \"allowed\" to have a visible boot or loading screen. He said that the system has to be available as soon as the car is started. Is this true? Are there any requirements for car PCs and the software running on it? And if so, where can I find these requirements? I already tried searching for it but couldn't find anything. I am from Germany so i'm primarily interested in answers fitting the german law but i'm open for any information about this topic. Note: This is my first questio",
      "answer": "There is legislation known as \"E-Mark\" that pertains to electronic devices that are permanently installed in a vehicle. This car PC manufacturer is UK based and has a great description of the requirement. Excerpt: Prior to March 2009 the regulations were extremely clear - all equipment installed into a vehicle on a permanent basis was required to be E-mark certified, and it was illegal to drive a vehicle that was fitted with non-compliant equipment. The regulations were changed in March 2009 and now require only devices related to safety-relevant functionality to be E-mark certified. Importantly, devices that have the potential to distract the driver are included in the safety-relevant category. Vehicle computers, which are capable of producing both audible and visual signals, clearly fall under this category and therefore still require E-mark certification. However, as I also stated in my comments, I think that many of these rules and regulations are meant for manufacturers and businesses. If you want to make one computer and install it in your car, I'm not sure if any of this applies. You probably need to worry about anything that a police officer would see as an obvious distraction or safety issue like playing movies for the driver or hiding your view of the road or instruments on the dash, but I don't what other technicalities apply to an individual. Update I was curious so I emailed the company quoted above to see what they had to say about someone building a one-off car computer. They didn't seem to have a definitive answer but this is what they said: Thanks for your email. It's my understanding that if a person drives a vehicle with non-approved equipment fitted then they are potentially committing an offense. However, I can't comment on how likely you are to run into trouble if it's your own personal vehicle and the equipment was fitted by you.",

However, when I started reading the many one star reviews, things didn't look so simple or safe. Many people destroyed their compressors, by either overfilling or by the sealant clogging their compressors. Quoting one reviewer: I have spoken to a couple of different shops and both have said they see person after person come in with issues from these home kits.

Well that isn't nearly enough information since the weight is what is important. and another one: Don't use this unless you ",
      "answer": "What issues can I run into trying to recharge my A/C refrigerant myself? The most common DIY problem is overfilling oil, under or overcharging refrigerant and installing the virus that are sealants. What equipment do I need to do it safely? Gloves and safety glasses. The PAG oil used is not good for humans and the gas can cause frostbite. What issues are there with sealants? Sealants rarely work well if at all. They can plug critical parts such as expansion devices or heat exchangers. Should I get a refill that contains compressor oil? No, the oil amount is set during build and it impossible to know how much is might have been lost. Overfilling reduces system performance and under filling will destroy the compressor. Would I be better off just paying a shop to do it? Yes There are two key issues that make this a non-DIY job. A high vacuum must be pulled on the system to ensure that every last bit of air is out. And the refrigerant must be carefully weighed during installation. A few ounces over or under can significantly affect system performance. The DIY install systems only show one of the available pressure readings and in any case charge amount cannot be determined from pressure readings.",

Surely, there must be some way of engineering a new brake design that would allow for the use of this technology on a more conventional car powered by a normal internal combustion engine. What I don't understand is: What exactly is regenerative braking? Why can we only use regenerative braking on electric and hybrid cars? Is there any reason why we can't use this clever braking technology in order to increase power to the crankshaft or reduce fuel consumption? Image Source: http://sjam4uphysics.pbworks.com/w/page/38936885/Regenerative%20Braking",
      "answer": "tl;dr: We do. It's just expensive. One of the differences between electric and chemical energy motors is that the electric systems make it much more convenient to capture and retain energy (e.g., a battery). All you need to do is use induction to create an electric current right there at the wheel while braking. Point that current at that battery and you've retained energy that would otherwise be wasted. With a chemical energy motor, it's a lot harder to store excess energy. We can't use the brakes to generate more gasoline, for example. However, it is possible to retain kinetic energy in something like a KERS. This will use the energy in braking to spin up a flywheel. That flywheel can then be used for additional motive power when needed. Unfortunately, KERS units are expensive and require a bunch of additional engineering (how, exactly, are you going to get that spinning flywheel to actually push the car forward?). They're also not common so they don't benefit from economies of scale. All that said, they do work. Formula One has used them to great effect as a passing boost system. I wouldn't use that sort of capability on the road but I'd be happy to experiment with anything that helps me get more oomph out of a gallon of gas.",

      "answer": "First of all, I don't really know much about motorcycles, so don't beat me... For a good comparison, one needs torque/hp diagrams. However, they are not easily to find on the web for certain models. In most cases, you will find plots showing curves before/after tuning. I tried a little and found these two bikes, which hopefully are comparable in this question. This are the curves for a Harley Davidson Fat Boy Low. (It has \"only\" 1584cm³): And I found something similar for the Yamaha Vmax 1700 with 1679cm³ (I hope, this is appropriate): This bike is made for lots of torque and high speed. Now, let's compare the curves. I've extracted them and brought to the same unit (mainly torque, but there's also a small difference between imperial (hp) and metric (PS) power): The Harley delivers nearly maximum torque at 2000RPM, and keeps going until 4000RPM, after which the torque decreases. That's also the RPM where it's finally outperformed by the Yamaha in each, torque and power. (I've also added the curves of the tuned bikes and there, the Yamaha outperforms the Harley from the beginning.) It's not clear how exact these curves are. For example, I also found a site stating about 125Nm torque for this Harley, while the curve shows 115 only. But in general, Harleys are usually driven at low RPM, where they have more torque and more power than that 140PS Yamaha bike. May be, the Yamaha is an extreme example, but keep in mind, the Harley compared here has just 1.5l displacement.",

I have just realised that I have got absolutely no idea how the kinetic (movement) energy of the crankshaft is able to make the wheels go round and also vary the speed of the wheels based on the drivers' input. I know that somewhere there is a clutch, a gearbox and a \"diff\" that allows the wheels to turn at different speeds (going round a corner for example). Do all these things run off of the flywheel?

      "answer": "A flywheel serves four main purposes (in most vehicles): It provides mass for rotational inertia to keep the engine in motion It is specifically weighted to provide balance for the crankshaft It provides a means to get the engine started (starter ring) It provides a connection for power transfer between the engine and transmission (along with the clutch it also provides a means to interrupt the power flow) Another such item, like unto a flywheel is a flexplate. This is a thin plate which connects the engine to a torque converter in automatic transmissions. While it provides the starting, connection, and balance of a flywheel, it alone does not have enough mass to provide the rotational inertia. In this case, the torque converter provides this for the engine.",

      "answer": "Let me lead off with an excellent book on the topic: Corky Bell's Maximum Boost. There is a sound treatment of the basics of turbocharger operation in addition to some dated and esoteric applications that are still interesting. For example, I find the discussion of turbocharging different types of carburetor to be of intellectual if not practical interest. To summarize the points called out in your question, here are some of the major aspects of the turbocharged engine that are of interest: The air flow: remember that an internal combustion engine is effectively an air pump. If we're talking about an engine that is operating \"under load\", we can assume that you've opened the throttle. For example, when rolling down hill, you don't need to hit the throttle so the entire intake to exhaust path is pumping a smaller air mass. However, driving uphill will require you to open the throttle (give it gas), adding air to the intake. This causes the engine computer to add fuel to the mixture. The fuel-air mixture is burned to produce energy. The exhaust from this combustion then proceeds to ... The turbine: this is part that looks like the front of a jet engine sitting in the exhaust gas path. The turbine sits on one end of a spinning shaft. On the other side is the compressor. That is the part that actually makes the boost on the intake side of the engine. The more exhaust gas pushes past the turbine, the more it wants to spin and make boost on the compressor side. However, there is also ... The wastegate: this is a valve that also sits in the exhaust gas path. It provides a short cut for the exhaust if the engine does not really need boost at this time. This can be used for peak boost control (too much boost can physically destroy your engine). This can be a purely mechanical sprung valve that stays closed up to a certain positive pressure in the intake path and then progressively opens as boost increases. It could also be under the direct control of the engine computer. For",

Could this cause problems for my car? Would it help with the diagnosis?",
      "answer": "Fuses do not need to be replaced unless they have blown, so it's not a regular maintenance thing. In terms of checking them, depending on your vehicle, many only require a visual check to see if the metal is present or missing. If you do have fuses where their status is not obvious, a good multimeter is only a few dollars (probably cheaper than replacing all the fuses, anyway) - and you will find it useful round the house, and for other small jobs once you have one. Make sure you get a reputable brand. Replacing all the fuses should not cause any problems with your car, unless you get the fuses wrong, or don't fully seat them etc. On balance, much better off just testing them all with a meter.",

So we opened the hoods, dug out the jumpstart cables and then got stuck. Under the hood of the hybrid Camry is very unfamiliar territory. I think I was able to identify an internal combustion engine in there, but there was nothing that remotely resembled a good, ol' fashioned lead-acid battery with red and black posts to clip the jump leads to. Now by definition, hybrid cars have oodles of battery power, but is any of this whizzy new battery power available to jumpstart hapless internal-combustion vehicles whose century-old technology has given out on them? In other words, can a I use a hybrid vehicle to jumpstart a non-hybrid vehicle? If so, how? Case in point is a Toyota Camry hybrid, but I'd also be interested in the general case (any hybrid or full electric vehicle).",
      "answer": "There are two power systems on all electric cars (fully electric and hybrids alike). This is in conjunction with the much higher voltage battery packs which normally power the electric motors. The reason for this extra power system is to power things like lights, electronics, and HVAC systems (to name a few). Most hybrid vehicles (and never a fully electric vehicle) do not have an alternator. Instead they have a DC to DC converter which steps down the power from the battery pack to recharge the 12v lead-acid battery. You can use this 12v system to jump other vehicles. The key is to know where the battery is located. In some cars, it is located in the trunk area. In other cars it is located up front. In yet other cars the battery is not easily accessed, but there are power provisions (studs) which allow you to clamp onto with jumper cables. It is good to know exactly where your 12v battery is located not only for jumping other vehicles, but also in case your vehicle ever needs to be jumped. I have seen noted to be careful when jumping your car or jumping to another car. You need to use the cables to charge the dead battery. Don't let there be large surges of electricity or you can damage electronics. If you leave the jumper cables in place for a while, this will allow some electricity to build up in the dead battery before you try to actually start the other vehicle. As small as this auxiliary battery is on a fully electric car, I don't think I'd use it to jump another vehicle, though you would still need to know where it's at in case you ever need to get it started.",

Is it worth the extra cost in an older vehicle? For example: Valvoline makes a conventional, Max Life blend, and Full Synthetic oil products.",
      "answer": "Check with your dealer or manufacturer to see if synthetic is usable in your car first of all. For example, RX-7s have traditionally recommended against synthetic because they inject some oil into the combustion chamber and synthetic oils don't work as well for sealing the \"apex seals\" in this application. Beyond that, there is also a theory that synthetic oils may break down sludge and varnish which is sealing what would otherwise be leaks. So switching to a synthetic may cause a car that has no leaks to start leaking. I've never had that happen or known that to happen, but they do promote reducing sludge and varnish as a feature of synthetics. However, if you have a turbocharged car, I'd use synthetic in it in any case. Turbochargers run at extremely high temperatures and are lubricated and cooled by oil. Synthetics react better to extremely high temperatures, so they are particularly useful in turbo applications. That said, I've had some mixed results with Synthetics that make me question their worth. One situation was an old '86 Subaru GL-10 wagon I had. It had a turbo and I put Mobile-1 in the engine and Red Line in the trans-axle. My wife and I took the car up to Canada on one trip where it was -25 to -45 degrees. The car ran surprisingly well, including shifting, compared to my experience in Colorado which rarely gets below -10. That was a clear win for the synthetics. A decade ago I had a '89 VW Vanagon that I put a new engine in. After the initial break-in, I ran nothing by Mobile-1 in it. I had all sorts of problems with it keeping oil pressure up, which went away when I switched to a high quality regular oil (Delo 400) at a mechanics' recommendation. Around 5 years ago my '97 Audi, which I had run from the first oil change with Mobile-1, had 2 of the lifters go quite badly, in what I'd consider a lubrication-related failure. Here is a picture: Now, maybe this was a design problem, but I haven't heard of it being common on these engines. SO my take on it i",

      "context": "So...lugging the engine obviously isn't something that is good. But why? For example when you feather a clutch to get the car moving, it lugs for a quick moment when you hit the catch point (When giving it no gas). Or at least it does in my car (2014 VW GTI). Is this a really bad habit, I only feather it when im moving slowly in say....traffic jams, or drive throughs and such. Thanks!",
      "answer": "Lugging an engine is like hammering the engine parts with every explosion in a cylinder. It racks on the rod bearing/journals, makes the pistons slap the side of the cylinders hard, and if is done enough, could probably break piston rings. It also creates a hammer effect all the way through the drivetrain. There are springs in the friction disk (of the clutch) which takes up some of this hammering, but they will only take so much before they wear out as well. This causes premature wear all the way around. It's not like it will wear out tomorrow, but it will cause wear over time. If you want your car to last a while, you don't want to be doing this. I think the major problem with what you are doing is, you aren't doing it right. It sounds like you are just trying to take off from a stop (or slow roll) without revving the engine at all. You should bring the engine up in rpm to around 1500 to 2000 rpm when starting to slip the clutch. You should get used to slipping the clutch in either situation (stopped or slow roll) no matter where you are at. To get it down, you should press on the pedals like you would a bicycle. Basically, as you press on one, you should allow the other to come up, so: gas pedal down slightly while allowing the clutch pedal to come out; and visa-versa - clutch pedal down while allowing the gas pedal to come out. Over time and experience, this becomes second nature. You will figure out (mainly by feel) where the engine needs to be at in speed in order to get the car moving. This will keep you from lugging the engine at all. EDIT: Here is an Engineering Explained video about lugging your engine and why it's bad. He gets a lot more technical than I did above, adds to what I've said, but it definitely concurs with it (I believe).",

      "answer": "What does the power at different rpm mean? Does it mean Car 1 has better power than Car 2 because it is at lower rpm? It depends. Or does the rpm not affect the power comparison? tl;dr: The rpm of the power peak affects the engine's usability for different applications. The \"peak power\" number is just one point on the power band of the engine. Ideally, you'd like to know the entire curve (and how its affected by ambient air temperature, altitude, humidity, phases of the moon, etc): In this figure, we see the horsepower and torque curves for two engines (where torque is solid and horsepower is dotted). Remember, torque is the engine working on the axles and, thereby, the wheels and tires. This is what accelerates the car forward. If you know the torque of the engine at a particular rpm, you can calculate the horsepower at that rpm: horsepower = (torque * rpm) / 5252 Admittedly, the above equation is specific to crazy old-time Imperial units. Insert appropriate conversion factors if you'd like to get metric units out instead. Very casually, you can imagine horsepower (or \"power\" if you're being unit agnostic) as being \"that which maintains speed in spite of drag.\" We generally expect a high horsepower vehicle to have a higher top speed (provided that it has the gearing to reach that speed). Looking at the above equation, you can also see that, in these units, the horsepower and torque curves always cross at 5252 rpms (i.e., the scalar values are equal even though they're totally different units). So what? All of the above helps you understand what the manufacturer is telling you a bit better. What's missing is \"what do you want from a car?\" Going back to the chart, you can see that the blue line has a torque peak at about 2500 rpm and that it doesn't drop off until about 4000 rpm. This means that, from a stop, the car will feel like it pulls away strongly, right away. However, as the rpms get much higher, the engine will seem to run out of breath, accelerating much sl",

      "context": "When building an engine, the terms over-square and under-square come up. What do these terms mean? How do they apply to engine building? Which is better for what purpose? Can you give examples of each and their usage?",
      "answer": "You Asked What do these terms mean? These terms are related to the bore and stroke measurements of a pistons travel inside a bore of an internal combustion engine. Bore is the diameter of the cylinder. Stroke is the distance a piston travels within a bore. What does under-square and over-square mean? Under-square refers to a piston diameter measurement that is smaller than the stroke length measurement. Over-square refers to the opposite. A stroke length measurement that is smaller than a piston diameter measurement. How do they apply to engine building? They are essential components to accomplishing a particular goal in engine building. A larger bore allows a larger piston. A larger piston allows for a larger combustion chamber. A larger combustion chamber allows for larger valves which will effect the quantity of gasses that can potentially flow through the ICE. In pushrod engines a longer bore can create more valve reciprocating weight due to the longer pushrods. In DOHC engines a shorter stroke and a larger piston can allow for a higher RPM and more efficiency at higher RPM's due to less reciprocating weight related to the connecting rods, pistons and crankshaft. Which is better for what purpose? Typically, a long stroke will result in an engine with higher torque at lower RPM due to the higher reciprocating mass. A short stroke can result in greater engine performance if the engine is designed for high RPM running. Engines typically become more efficient at higher RPM's, to a point. Can you give examples of each and their usage? In motorcycles the Ducati Desmosedici powerplant has an over-square configuration. A short stroke with a very large piston.

      "question": "What is happening when a two-stroke engine is said to be &quot;four-stroking&quot;?",
      "context": "Many years ago, I was involved in a hobby of building and flying model aircraft. The aircraft used alcohol-fueled 2-stroke engines with glow plug ignitions. When these engines ran rich (and always at idle), they produced a distinctively different sound to when they ran with the throttle mostly or fully opened and the mixture leaned to deliver the highest RPM. That difference in sound was informally described as \"four-stroking\". I've heard a similar effect in larger two-stroke engines as well - weed trimmers and motorcyles - so it seems to be a characteristic of two-stroke engines in general, not just the small, model aircraft variety. My question is: what is going on in these engines when they \"four-stroke\"? It seems as though combustion is only occurring on every other top-dead/power stroke. Is this true? If so, why? What prevents the charge from igniting on one stroke while allowing it to occur on the next, and repeat the alternating pattern? In the case of the glow plug engine, how ",
      "answer": "Wikipedia describes four-stroking as: Four-stroking is an undesirable operating condition of two-stroke engines, where they instead begin to fire every four strokes, rather than every two strokes. This firing is uneven, noisy and may even damage the engine if allowed to continue unabated. Four-stroking was often a cause of poor idling in two stroke engines. It then describes what's happening: Two stroke engines rely on effective scavenging in order to operate correctly. This clears out the combustion exhaust gases from the previous cycle and allows refilling with a clean mix of air and fuel. If scavenging falters, the mixture of unburnable exhaust gas with the new mixture may produce an overall charge that fails to ignite correctly. Only when this charge is further diluted, by pumping through a second volume of clean mixture, does it become inflammable again. The engine thus begins to 'fire-and-miss' every second cycle (every four strokes), rather than correctly on every cycle. So, yes it's true that it is only igniting every other intended power stroke. In some worse cases an engine can six- or eight-stroke, igniting every third or fourth power stroke. The reason seems to be that the exhaust isn't purged completely and leans out the mixture on the next stroke and isn't rich enough to ignite leaves a mixture on the next stroke that cannot be ignited until the following stroke which then produces exhaust that again isn't purged completely. The more exhaust left in the cylinder, the more skipped strokes. Model engines are affected differently because of their small scale: Four-stroking is a common and expected behaviour with model engines, both glow fuel and diesel. These small engines run at extremely high rotational speeds and their scavenging relies upon this. When started, they run as inertially-scavenged four strokes and have a distinctive change in engine note when they accelerate past the point at which they begin to operate as two strokes. Owing to the scaling",

      "question": "Why did Ducati decide to use the desmodromic valve train rather than a more tradition valve train?",
      "context": "Ducati's use a unique method to open and close their valves. It's called the desmodromic valve train. The desmodromic valve system does not use springs to close the valve, it uses the cam and has a valve closing lobe. What are the benefits to removing valve springs from the valve train? Why did Ducati use this type of valve mechanism as opposed to a more tradition under the bucket shim design?",
      "answer": "Ducati use desmodromic valve systems because it provides for; A more faithful adherence to both; (1A) Not just high speed Valvetrain timing. (1B) But also high acceleration Valvetrain rates; regardless of what weight/material the valve is made from. The latter (1B) - which can provide an advantage over the pneumatic Valvetrain design approach - allows for a more optimal and square-wave like Valvetrain function; a function that most typical valve-spring Valvetrains (even at moderate speeds) simply can’t accommodate. An alternative to pneumatic Valvetrain design approaches used by other manufacturers in MotoGP; that - if implemented correctly - can also provide both weight savings and also cylinder head port geometry benefits. Footnote Ducati's desmodromic valve system was (contrary to popular belief) not invented by them, it does actually employ springs (see links below), and (some of) the significant considerations and/or drawbacks of the desmodromic valve approach are as follows; A complicated design involving phase-conjugate camshaft design and machining that performs marginally better than most modern day high performance valve-spring alternatives. Please note how: : a) Most comparable Japanese (and some European) motorcycles using traditional valve-spring alternatives not only reliably rev higher than Ducati's desmodromic valve system, but also do so without loss of power when compared to Ducati. b) Several other Japanese and European motorcycles using both (i) the same 90 degree “L” and/or “V” twin engine configuration and capacity as Ducati, and (ii) traditional valve-spring alternatives; not only produce similar and/or more power than Ducati - but also do so quite reliably. c) Ducati’s desmodromic valve system employed in their earlier 900 SS models (that shared an almost identical engine 860cc design to their 860/900 GTS range) provided no real meaningful power/torque benefit over the their 860/900 GTS range - at least not one that could not easily be attain",

      "context": "Recently, my car (2000 Mercury Grand Marquis) started sounding like a racecar: the engine became very loud. There's clearly something going wrong with the exhaust system. I'm trying to understand the problem. I took a peek under the car, and I think I've identified the issue, but I don't know enough to say for certain. One of the connections in the exhaust pipes seems to have come loose. Could this be the root of the problem? In contrast, the pipe's brother appears in much better shape. Thanks in advance!",
      "answer": "Yes, at least half of the exhaust is coming straight out of that gap without passing through the muffler. As you've noted, this leads to an increase in noise (or music, depending on your taste). To my eye, that looks like a hassle to fix on your own. There appears to be the rusted remnants of two bolts holding the Y-pipe to the passenger side muffler and perhaps the merest wisp of a gasket remaining. I suspect that you're going to have to cut and drill out those old rusted bolts just to disengage the two pipes. A repair will either require those old bolts out, clear holes, clean mating surfaces, a new gasket, new bolts and lots of anti-seize. None of that is expensive but it's something of a drag. If you've been thinking about an aftermarket exhaust system, this might be a good time to make a purchase. I'd suggest looking for a system that includes both pipes leading to the mufflers and the Y-pipe leading back from the catalytic converter. This picture summarizes nicely why I like stainless steel in all exhaust components.",

I need to know if I can install another car battery in parallel, and will there be any negative side effects ? I know that a battery in parallel should work, as both will charge and discharge together. And I will get enough power to charge phones while driving (or when engine is set to idle). What will it take to get this working ? Or is it even possible ?",
      "answer": "Yes it can be easily done, but based on your scenario it's not necessary unless you want to sit for extended periods without running the engine. If you are going to leave the vehicle running for Air Conditioning for instance then you don't need to do anything it should work fine as equipped from the factory. Here are some things to consider If you still want to install a second battery: Mounting Location If there is room under the hood that's the best place, if you have to mount it inside you need to make sure you use a vented (to the outside) battery case. Batteries can put off explosive vapors when they charge and discharge so you don't want it venting inside the vehicle. Location will also limit the physical size of the battery. Battery Type I would recommend a deep cycle battery over a car battery as they are designed to be repeatedly charged and discharged. They are the least expensive options. You can also look at Gel Cell, Nickel Metal Hydride (may not be suited for your application), or Lithium-ion. The more electrical capacity of the battery you choose the longer you can run without starting the vehicle. Battery Isolator This will allow you to charge both batteries automatically but will not let you run down your starting battery. Keep in mind if you are using dome lights or anything else that's factory installed it will run the cranking battery down. You don't have to do this as simply connecting them in parallel will work, you just risk running down the cranking battery. Here are some examples of battery isolators High Performance Battery Isolator 140 Amp Auto Isolator I, Model #: 091-139-2-12 The factory equipped alternator should be sufficient for your application",

It was the first time I've done this on a car, though I have done it countless times on various motorcycles. I was careful to apply proper torque to all fittings and verified everything was clear before installing the wheels and driving the car. The car drove fine all week and then today the brakes started pulsating and making a sound at the same moment of the pulse at 20 mph. At 30 mph, the pulsating and sound become scary, so I parked the car, put it up on jack stands, removed the wheels, and after inspection I can find nothing obviously wrong. I did notice that the right rotor has some visible scratches on it, but I can't see anything that could touch the rotor except the pads. The pulsating is perfectly rhythmic, so I'm fairly certain that whatever is causing the pulsating is also spinning. The rotors and pads are from Autozone.",

Is there merit to that claim? Does anyone have any idea how he may have come up with that idea? If so, then why?",
      "answer": "This is a myth. A lot of old-school mechanics and non-chemistry educated people repeat this false myth. When changing from synthetic to regular oil, there is not anything special that you need to do because synthetic oil will mix directly with regular oil of the same weight (no engine flush is needed). There is some differences between synthetic and regular oil. Synthetic oil has detergents and chemicals to protect the longevity of your engine. ericthecarguy.com has a great YouTube video that talks extensively about the differences of synthetic vs regular oil and answers lots of common questions: [2013-02-04 Regular Oil vs Synthetic Oil -EricTheCarGuy]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zEBI1QndPo) A Valvoline scientist publicly stated switching from synthetic oil to regular oil not do anything to your engine. Additionally Valvoline has a public website that states this myth is false https://www.valvoline.com/about-us/faq/synthetic-oil-myths : *MYTH: Once you’ve used synthetic motor oil you can’t switch to conventional motor oil. * Not true. Synthetic and conventional oils are compatible, so it is not harmful if you decide to switch.\" Even Mobil1 reps agree with it. Trust me, this has been such a topic of issue; They just decided why not put the myth to the test. So, you should be fine. Your engine may get dirtier quicker, and the oil should be changed more often, but other than that you'll be fine. update- After researching what Paulster2 commented on my reply, he is right. You shouldn't need to do a flush. He also commented a link to a guy is well versed in the subject. So I was wrong about that.",

      "question": "Why or why not increase engine efficiency by running the car &quot;fuel-lean&quot; (using a turbo or supercharger)?",
      "context": "Everyone wants their cars to use less fuel, right? I read the following passage about running the car fuel lean from this website: Run the engine fuel-lean, that is, use excess air. It is well known that fuel-lean running improves the efficiency. In the old days, under cruising conditions, the engines always ran lean – about 15% excess air -- this was economical. So what happen to change this? The problem is the three-way (CO, UHC, NOx) catalyst used on engine exhausts. This only works if the engine air/fuel ratio (by mass) is stoichiometric (chemically correct). For gasoline this ratio is 14.6:1. The engine computer, acting in concert with the engine air flow sensor, electronic fuel injectors, and exhaust oxygen sensor, maintains the stoichiometric ratio for most of your driving. Only at this ratio can the catalyst both oxidize the CO and UHC (to CO2 and H2O) and chemically reduce the NOx (to N2). (UHC = unburned hydrocarbons.) What humankind needs is a lean-NOx catalyst. Then we coul",
      "answer": "Lean ≠ More Air I believe the source of the misunderstanding is in how the term \"lean\" is being interpreted. A lean mixture doesn't indicate the presence of more air. It indicates the presence of a higher proportion of air compared to fuel (air-fuel ratio, or AFR). Quick example Mixture A has 1,000 g of air, 80 g of fuel. AFR = 1000/80 = 12.5 Mixture B has 100 g of air, 7 g of fuel. AFR = 100/7 = 14.3 Since 14.3 > 12.5, Mixture B is leaner than Mixture A, even though Mixture A has more air. This is why @cdunn is right; the presence of a turbocharger or supercharger doesn't impact the ability of an appropriately-sized catalytic converter from doing its job. So why is it not good for cats to run lean? A catalytic converter is designed to scrub harmful gases out of exhaust gases. It does this through a chemical reaction that involves the presence of catalyst(s). The most popular type of cat design today is the three-way catalytic converter, which handles three types of harmful gases: nitrogen oxides (NOx, not NOS) carbon monoxide (CO) unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) The catch is that cats work well in a narrow AFR window, as this image shows: Run too lean, and the cat will have a hard time scrubbing NOx out of the exhaust gases Run too rich, and your tailpipe will have a lot more HC, CO content",

I am guessing that it goes in rotating the flywheel and crankshaft and stuff, but I am not so sure. Any detailed explanation would be appreciated. Also, when we release the clutch the rpm seem to go down, why does it happen?",
      "answer": "Combustion raises the temperature of the gases in the cylinder. Not all of this can be used to do mechanical work, some of it is wasted in heating the engine itself and the rest is lost when the heated gases are exhausted from the cylinder. The engine contains a lot of moving parts. Whenever you have moving parts in contact you have friction, which takes away some of the engine's energy in wear and heat generation. In a typical car, the engine is the source of power for the whole vehicle, so a lot of other equipment has to be powered by the engine. The alternator takes some of the energy away to charge the battery. Power from the battery is used to power engine electronics including spark ignition for fuels that require it, the engine management electronics and to start the engine. Further power is taken to power all of the electronics in the rest of the vehicle; radio, dashboard lights, interior lights, exterior lights, etc. The engine must be cooled, so in most engines some power is used to drive a mechanical or electric water pump to circulate cooling water. This water is passed through a radiator, which works best with good airflow, so where there is little airflow (e.g. in a stationary vehicle) a mechanical, electric or hydraulic fan is driven to force air over the radiator. The aforementioned friction can be reduced by lubricating parts, so lubricating oil needs to be circulated to these parts, often with a mechanical oil pump. If the vehicle is fitted with air-conditioning this will either be electrically or mechanically driven. Engines may be fitted with turbo- or superchargers to increase their power at higher rpms, but at idle these act as a small additional load. The fuel is often situated some distance from the engine, so must be pumped from the tank to the engine. In regards to the engine speed dropping when the clutch is engaged: Many components taking power from the engine take more power when the engine is spinning faster. As such, there is a particu",

      "context": "Why do diesel automotive engines redline at around 4500 rpm whereas petrol ones go to 6500-8000 rpm? Does this have something to do with the compression ratio?",
      "answer": "In Short its based on low burn rate of diesel plus the longer stroke of the diesel engine. First you must understand the difference between these engines, the diesel works on purely compression of fuel , heating and generating bang to produce power, the gasoline on the other hand is natively twitchy and needs a spark to explode and produce power on its own. That said, Think of the petrol engine as a cheetah, it has lightweight bones and has a streamlined body thus is very fast but is not powerful enough to kill a lion or a rhino. The Diesel engine is like an elephant, its slow and has a lot of strength, but needs heavier legs to support the huge body mass thus it cant run as fast as the cheetah but has a lot of strength. By strength of the elephant I mean torque in the engine. The petrol engine natively combusts so it does not need heavy duty parts to withstand the explosion, yes you are compressing the fuel but its not nearly as much as the diesel, that is why 100cc motorcycles rev like crazy they have lightweight construction (cranks, pistons). The diesel does not combust as much as petrol, it needs to be compressed to a much higher extent to combust thus the cylinder head, the piston, the crank everything needs to be heavy duty to withstand the compression explosion thus slowing down the speed of the piston. Finally to answer your question: Diesel burns slowly compared to petrol and for most diesel engines the limit is around 4800 to 5000 RPM. Adding clarity to the above point, in a petrol engine almost 95% of the fuel is burnt in every stroke but in the diesel engine not all of the diesel is burnt in each stroke due to the slow combustion rate some diesel remains in the cylinder before the next stroke so no matter how hard you push, that small quantity of diesel will not burn before the piston is ready for the next stroke thus limiting the speed or redline.",

      "context": "I accidentally drove my 2000 Grand Marquis on second gear on the highway. I was going 65 for like 5 minutes and tried to get it to 70mph but the car was shaking, when I realized I put it into regular drive while going 65 and it stopped shaking. Is there any damage that this can do to my car?",
      "answer": "It's definitely not great. The redline is there for a reason. That shaking was likely the engine speed limiter looking at the RPMs and saying, \"yes, that's high enough.\" The speed limiter can be either an ignition cutoff or a fuel cutoff - both will make the car feel very shaky. The most common bad consequence of an overspeed condition when the engine speed limiter fails to thwart the operator is a bent valve. There's a lot going on in the engine when it's turning at several thousand RPMs: if the valve does not have time to return to its seat before the piston comes back up, the piston is going to hit the valve harder than you would like. Of course, that's not the only possibility, just the most common that I've heard of. In short, listen to your car and be glad that the limiter worked that time.",

      "context": "Background There are quite a few head gasket related questions on the site. Coolant or water in the oil, oil in the coolant or water in a radiator, etc. I'm thinking that some instruction on howto use a leak down tester is in order. With that, I am interested in hearing responses related to the following. Questions 1. How do I operate a leak down tester? 2. Why is there an air pressure regulator on a leak down tester 3. What are some of the issues I can troubleshoot with a leak down tester? 4. If I have a blown head gasket where would on the car would I listen for an air leak in order to determine if my head gasket is blown?",
      "answer": "There are many leak down testers on the market. You can actually make your own with some hardware store parts and a fish tank. Operation of \"most\" leak down testers The procedure of operation depends on whether or not you have the cylinder head attached to the engine block or not. If the head is attached, your leak down tester should have an attachment that screws into the spark plug hole. Once fastened you can use your compressed air (usually around 100psi) to fill the the cylinder with air. It's very important to ensure that you have the cylinder that you are testing at TDCC (Top Dead Center Compression). This means that the cylinder is completely sealed and all valves are closed on that particular cylinder, thus giving you a nice platform for testing. Testing with head off When testing with the head off you often use a method similar to this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A26KfDj6wAM I do not swear by this method, and the guy seems to take a while to get to the point. So, you can form your own opinion on this. It's more fit for finding cracks on the head, however though I have found that sometimes my leak down tester finds a fault and it turns out to be a cracked head; That can be difficult to diagnose with the engine assembled; Just food for thought =) Air Pressure Regulator We use the air pressure regulator for a couple of reasons. Some cars have a higher compression rating than others, so you need to be able to regulate the pressure accordingly. When you're talking about pressure in the cylinder, we have a constant and combustion pressure. You want to be able to test up to your max combustion pressure, but also test a constant pressure that is a bit lower for fine tuned diagnostics. The reason for this is that the cylinder is not under CONSTANT 210psi and the cylinder actually jumps up a little more due to fuel and oil lubrication when running. To perform a good leak down test that yields good results, you need to be able to regulate pressure. The valves may",

      "context": "I have heard this idea several times, but is it true? Theories I read about why that might be true: The engine is running rich at startup because it is running in open loop, which can cause damage to the piston rings as the excess fuel wipes oil from the walls There is no oil at the upper parts of the engine (cylinder walls, cam shaft), so they are not lubricated enough, although in my 1993 miata the oil pressure gauge jumps up to 60 almost immediately after a cold start. Could that small gap of time cause significant wear? Cold oil does not work as well in lubricating the engine, but shouldn't synthetic oils or even multi grade conventional oils solve this issue?",
      "answer": "From advanced-auto-maintenance.com: It’s widely acknowledged by automotive engineers that most engine wear occurs within this first ten minutes of driving before the engine has reached its highest, normal operating temperature. From bloomberg.com: When you first start the vehicle, do not race the engine. Accelerate gradually until the engine (and the rest of the drivetrain) has completely warmed up; it takes about 10-15 minutes, depending on the outside temperature. Most engine wear occurs at cold-start and during the first few minutes of operation. Revving a cold engine will greatly accelerate this wear and tear. Basically, yes. It is true, and basically it's because the oil has settled and is no longer properly lubricating all the parts, creating a greater amount of friction and consequently, wear. For a more official source, check out https://www.motorists.org/blog/things-we-do-to-cars/. And Jim Kerr from the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada writes, Most engine wear occurs in the first couple minutes after a cold start. Rich fuel mixtures wash lubrication from the cylinder walls. Thick oil doesn’t spray onto moving parts as easily, so using a winter grade oil will help reduce engine wear. When the engine is first started, the oil pump forces oil into the oil passages and through the oil filter. The pleated filter element may restrict thick oil too much, so a bypass valve is designed into either the oil filter or the engine itself so the thick oil can bypass the filter. Oil may bypass the filter for only a few seconds or for nearly a minute if temperatures are cold and the oil viscosity is high. During this time, unfiltered oil flows to the engine, which is better than no oil, but it still allows dirt particles to flow to moving parts. Changing to a winter grade oil with lower viscosity helps keep bypass times short and provides faster lubrication to moving parts.

      "question": "What is the difference between a 180&#176; V4 and a true boxer motor?",
      "context": "Reading this thread which talks about V4 motors, I am wondering what exactly is the difference between a 180° V4 motor you'd find in a Subaru and a true boxer (or horizontally opposed) flat 4 cylinder?",
      "answer": "tl;dr: In common usage, there isn't a difference. The Subaru flat-4 is a boxer. Here's a lovely picture that I found on the Manchester Subaru site (I'm not a customer but I'm always encouraged when a dealer is willing to provide useful technical material!): As you can see from that picture, the pistons are moving in pairs: the two in the rear are in and the two in the front are out. This is where the boxer gets its name: the pistons look like they're punching each other. Getting into the technical details (see the great Wikipedia entry on flat engines): True boxers have each crankpin controlling only one piston/cylinder while the 180° engines, which superficially appear very similar, share crankpins. The 180° engine, which may be thought of as a type of V engine, is quite uncommon as it has all of the disadvantages of a flat engine, and few of the advantages. You have to look closely at the image above but you can see that the pistons are not sharing crank pins. In the image below we can see a true 180 degree V6 (on the left with shared crank pins) compared to a boxer flat-6 (on the right with individual crank pins as in the Subaru). \"Moteurs à Plat - V à 180° vs. Boxer\" by Frank Lente - http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datei:Boxermotor.png. Licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0 via Wikimedia Commons. As stated in the article, however, the 180 degree V4 is quite uncommon due to its technical limitations. Note those arrows in the left-hand diagram: instead of having opposing pistons box each other (somewhat cancelling vibration), they would be reinforcing each other. This would cause a truly distressing torque of the whole engine around the vertical axis, with the direction changing every half rotation of the crankshaft. As the 180 degree V4 with shared crank pins is so uncommon, the flat-4 boxer effectively takes its place in terms of \"what would you do if you need to increase the angle to 180 degrees?\" Therefore, in the common usage we consider a 180 degree V4 and a flat-4 to be",

      "question": "What can I do to combat wire embrittlement?",
      "context": "I live in a very hot climate where temperatures regularly touch 45 deg C and the heat in the engine bay area means that under-hood wires, especially the thinner ones, endure high levels of thermal fatigue. As a result, when working on older cars (10+ years) I am very apprehensive about flexing any wiring in the engine bay area in case I introduce a break (and a new headache). This includes wires for things like coolant temp sensor, MAF sensor, coil and injector power supply Is there anything that one can do to delay the onset of wire embrittlement? Would it help if manufacturers use a different grade/gauge of wire to help with longevity?",
      "answer": "The very short answer is that heat isn't a significant problem for the wire. Heat is a problem for the insulation. So if you have wires failing I think there is something else going on. The problem with dealing with failing insulation is that there isn't much you can do about it – short of rewiring the affected parts. In a modern car that could be a non-trivial project. As Agent_L mentioned there are good high temperature insulation materials, but retrofitting them isn't really practical in many cases. There are a few practical things you can do: Heat shrink tubing, though this usually requires reterminating the wire since most heat shrink won't shrink enough to fit over most connectors. Electrical tape, it's not elegant, but it can be effective and is relatively easy to do. \"Paint on\" electrical tape – I've never used the stuff, but it is available and it might work well in some applications, I think it would do a better job of excluding moisture than tape. If the affected area is small and the car is old one of the easier approaches might be to replace the section of the wiring harness, or to rebuild it. If the car is old then I wouldn't even worry too much about getting better wire, unless it is a classic, as the replacement wire will last for many years before it fails.",

      "answer": "There are a number of ways this can be done. It can range from a two person job, with on one the pedal and the other at the bleed nipple, to a one man job where the new fluid is forced through the system under external pressure. For DIY purposes the most common is the two man (person?) way. Person A is at the nipple, which has a hose attached and the other end is submerged in a jar with some brake fluid in it, opens and closes the bleed valve. Person B is at the brake pedal and presses down when A tells him to, which should be just before A opens the bleed valve. Once the pedal has been depressed (not too suddenly) person A closed the valve and tells B to release the pedal. The procedure is repeated until no more bubbles are seen to come out. It's vital to check the fluid level regularly, because if it drops too low you have to start allover again. Tools required: Ring spanner to fit the nipple. Don't even think about trying this with an open-ender - you'll simply round it over. Hose to fit the nipple. Coffee jar or similar with a little brake fluid already in it. A helper who can follow simple up/down directions and can put up with you growling when they get it wrong. Brake fluid. Preferably a different colour to what is currently in the system, so that you will know when the old stuff has been fully pushed out.

      "context": "Recently, I was informed that a car I share ('02 Nissan Sentra) was close to overheating. I was told it gets close to the upper limit very quickly upon running the car. When I inspected the vehicle, I realized that the coolant overflow was empty and the radiator's coolant level was rather low (not sure exactly how low but it seems at most 75% remains). The car must be taken to a mechanic. However, the mechanic I trust and usually use is about 30 miles away. I assume there is a leak in a hose, connector, or perhaps the water pump. The radiator is new so I do not suspect it is the source of this issue. Because I am assuming there will be a leak, I think that when I drive it, it will most likely loose coolant. Also because of this assumption, I am weary of putting coolant in if it is just going to leak out. I am assuming I will have to make a few stops to fill the overflow (not touching the radiator). Can I put pure water in the radiator and overflow tank and limp the car 30 miles (mostly",
      "answer": "First thing I'd try to figure out is how quickly it leaks - run it, stick your head underneath it as check if there is any visible leaking. If there is, chances are that it's not going to make it for 30 miles. I'd also check for any evidence of oil and water mixing. If there is, don't drive it. If it's not leaking that badly I'd be tempted to top it up with plain water just to check if that reduces the temperature to something more normal. If it doesn't there's a chance that you either have a thermostat that's failed closed, a blockage in the cooling system or a really bad water pump. Again, check for leaks with the engine running and warm, any visible leaks this side of the odd drip and I'd be very careful about driving the car. In general, water on its own tends to cool better than water + antifreeze, so you're not risking any damage from running water in the engine provided the outside temperature doesn't drop below freezing. Even then, you probably are going to be OK as hopefully there is a little antifreeze left in the existing coolant. Either way, advise the mechanic that he might have to drain the cooling system immediately depending on the outside temperatures. If in doubt, I would get the car transported to the mechanic - even if you pay retail for the recovery it's likely to be cheaper than a blown engine, unless the engine is fairly terminal already.",

      "answer": "It looks an awful lot like you have diagnosed all of the really hard problems and come up negative. I wonder if you have a simple mechanical problem: is the linkage sound between the hot / cold selector and the flapper valve that forces air past the heater core. From what I hear, the foam around the flapper is also prone to disintegration in humid climates: that would allow all or most of your heated air to escape. EDIT: I did manage to find a reasonable annotated heater core replacement. I think you're right: this job is a huge pain. And, no, I can't think of a way to get at the internal air direction valves. Yet another EDIT: Thinking about the diagnosis further, it occurs that you might be able to establish whether you have a bad seal on the flapper valve. This will work best on a very cold day. Run the car up to operating temperature with heater set to coldest and vent fan off. Set the vent fan to the least speed that will blow detectable airflow. This will ensure that you're not feeling artificially cold from the wooshing air from max vent fan. Check this baseline temperature as best you can: if you don't have a good thermometer, I find that a sniff test works for me. Seriously, the inside of your nose and sinuses are very sensitive to temperature. That's how I've detemined what coats and hats my kids needed to wear to school for years. Set the heater to max (this is where you'll hear the clunk of that valve flapping over). Wait for what heat is available to make it's way down the vent (i.e., a few minutes). Check the temperature again. If you have a working valve with a bad seal, you'll note a slight temperature change (see previous note on sniff test). Now, even with all of the above, fixing any of these problems will be approximately the same level of hassle. You're going to have to take off the dash, etc. My hope is that, if you do invest the time, you'll know what you're looking for.

      "question": "When does it make sense to replace a camshaft?",
      "context": "Preamble (Rant) I was reviewing this question in which the OP presents a repair quotation that includes replacing the \"intake camshaft\" to fix an engine that had overheated. To me this recommendation is incredulous. I can understand the need to replace a warped cylinder head, but struggle to see how an overheating problem could lead to the need for a new camshaft. As an aside, some aftermarket tuners will create new camshaft profiles by grinding down existing OEM ones; if there was a sensible reason to use a new one I'm pretty sure they would be among the first ones to do so. Questions What things could happen to a camshaft that warrant its complete replacement? For the different ways that a camshaft can fail/break, are there any techniques out there to salvage a damaged camshaft?",
      "answer": "Obviously any physical damage; cracked, broken, bearing surface damage, sheared gear, etc... Any catastrophic failure warrants cam replacement without possibility of repair. A warped cylinder head could theoretically also warp the cam shaft but i would not just replace it, i would check it first. Place the cam in a set of V blocks. Put a dial indicator on the bearing surface and spin the camshaft. Watch how much the dial indicator deflects. The appropriate engine manual will have the warpage specs. The more subtle problems arise from lobe wear. A valve that does not open all the way could cause strange problems. At idle everything is fine but a misfire develops under power at high RPM. If the lift of the valve is reduced it won't allow as much air in which is most visible at high RPM. This is difficult to detect. A compression test may not reveal a problem. If every other possible issue is eliminated, pull the valve cover and compare lift of several valves. At worst the lobe is completely round and there is just no air entering or leaving the cylinder. This is easily detectable with a compression test. Theoretically the worn cam lobe can be reground to regain the lift. The problem with this technique is that not every valve train can compensate for the reduced base circle. Any car with adjustable valves can usually tolerate this. Any car with only hydrolic lifters normally can't.",

      "question": "What does it mean to retard an engine?",
      "context": "I have come across this term. What does it mean to retard an engine? When would you typically have to do such a thing? What can happen if you don't or incorrectly retard the engine? What sort of vehicle or machine require engine retarding?",
      "answer": "What does retarding an engine mean? Retarding an engine is essentially a vague, but blunt term. It just means that in one way or another, you are hindering the engines ability to provide driving force, and in some applications you are actually using a device to work against the engine and vehicle.. There are several ways to do this and several reasons for it. The most famous engine retarder is the Jake Brake. It was designed to open and close the exhaust valves very late to use the pressure from the engine in an attempt to retard the engine. This was done so that large machinery and semi trucks could come to a more quick and even stop. Rather than having to use and heat up their brakes while stopping or traveling downhill, this could be used instead. Here is a video of what it sounds like and a video demonstrating it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qocMoTOVn6Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl3NLWrj_sA Retarding the ignition timing Retarding the ignition timing can be useful for a few things, but is generally left untouched. Reasons for doing this would be for non-computer managed fuel economy, a car that has minor forced induction and non-computer management, if the vehicle isn't performing as desired, and some engines will actually benefit and gain horsepower from retarded timing. Hydraulic retarders Hydraulic retarders are essentially the same design as a torque converter in the sense that they have small veins that hydraulic fluid passes through. HOWEVER they do the opposite, they help slow down the motion of the drive-train. The reason for these can vary greatly. I've seen small cars with them, and typically you see large machinery with them. They serve the same purpose, but are more robust and can do a much quieter and smoother job of slowing things down. These are usually switched on and there are secondary pumps that help assist the hydraulic fluid in stopping what ever it is that you're trying to stop. Generally you would find it just after your drive sha",

      "question": "Diesel Engine Runaway - What is it?",
      "context": "I was watching some youtube videos and diesel engine runaway videos started to pop up where apparently the diesel engine runs out of control until it destroys itself. My Question What is diesel engine runaway? How does diesel engine runaway occur? Can it be prevented? I've never heard of this condition before. Here's another video just in case. :)",
      "answer": "Since the diesel has no physical throttle, power is controlled by limiting fuel. Air is always available so any unintended, un-metered fuel will cause the engine to increase rpm and power output. The most common sources are blowby oil and oil leaking from a worn turbocharger, these then pool in the intake manifold. This engine oil gets pulled into the engine during low load high rpm operation. It usually starts when the engine is revved up with no load, once a runaway starts the high air flow rates in the manifold continue to pull oil from the pool. While engine oil does not burn as well as diesel it will burn well enough to reach redline rpm in a warmed up engine. Preventative maintenance involves inspection and repair of worn parts with particular attention to piston rings and turbos. Design prevention should focus on eliminating areas in the intake that allow pooling so that incoming oil is processed a little at a time. To stop a run away engine plug the intake or open the compression brake valve.",

      "question": "What mechanical revolution is measured in &quot;RPM&quot;?",
      "context": "I do realize that it stands for revolutions per minute, but what are the revolving pieces that are measured? Assuming it is the crankshaft, is RPM calculated by the crank shaft sensor, or by some other means? Why do some old, carbureted cars not have a tachometer--is it for the lack of the ECU and the sensor? Here's a scenario: A 1,000cc 4-stroke engine with 4 cylinders is running at 1k RPM. How many times does each cylinder fire per second? How can this be calculated? Also, does the piston provide force to the crank shaft with each stroke, even during the exhaust stroke? Does the engine create equal torque with each stroke of the piston, or do each of the four strokes apply different amounts of power? If so, why don't the RPMs fluctuate with each different stroke of a cylinder?",
      "answer": "Ok, let's start from the same picture so we're on the same page: These engines are four stroke engines, which means the piston goes up and down a total of 4 times, twice up, and twice down for each cycle. So to answer your questions: Of course I do realize it stands for revolutions per minute, but revolutions of what? As you stated later, it's revolutions of the crank shaft. I assume the crank shaft, how is it calculated, is it by the crank shaft sensor? Why do some old cars that runs with a carburetor don't have the RPM meter is it for the lack of the ECU and the sensor? As for how it's measured, there are both mechanical and electrical ways to measure it. Older cars didn't have a tachometer just because they were not popular, and to limit the cost. Many older cars did have tachometers though, just mechanically driven. I'm not 100% sure where the pickoff was for this, but if I had to bet it was just a gear off the crankshaft that gets reduced to a needle movement on the dash. In the same way that the speedometer was usually a gear in the transmission that did the same thing just for wheel speed. As for the electrical methods, yes, it's just a sensor talking to the ECU which sends the right PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signal to a gauge in the dash. Also assuming a 1000 cc big 4 stroke engine with 4 cylinders running at 1k RPM how many times are each cylinder firing per second or how can that be calculated, also does the piston \"revolve\" the crank shaft with each stroke even at the exhaust stroke with the same torque or is it different at the firing stroke, if so how is the RPM not constantly going up and down with each different stroke To lay this out, lets look at how many times the shaft rotates with each stroke. From the diagram you can see that a full up and down path of the piston makes for one revolution of the crankshaft. That means in a four stroke engine the shaft rotates twice (two revolutions) for every four stroke cycle, which means one power stoke for ",

      "question": "Why is gas around a car battery only at risk of ignition from jumper cables?",
      "context": "As pointed out in Jump starting a dead battery: Connect black wire to negative pole of battery or grounded metal?, you connect the black jumper cable to the dead car's chassis to avoid sparks made during the connection near the battery, which could be surrounded by hydrogen gas. As Paul points out in Why should I connect the red/positive terminal first when jump starting?, this seems extremely unlikely, but okay, safety first. However, the advice is to attach the black cable to exposed metal on the chassis or engine block. The engine block on the average car is not that huge. I'm wondering, if the battery is surrounded by a cloud of hydrogen gas, and I connect the black terminal somewhere on the opposite end of the engine block, would it not still ignite the cloud of gas? Is the cloud of gas that tightly focused around the battery? Also, what about when you actually manage to start the car? Why is there no risk of igniting the gas cloud from the various heat- and spark sources when a c",
      "answer": "I am no expert in this topic, but I don't think a \"cloud of gas\" forms around the battery. Hydrogen gas is the lightest gas of them all (0.089 g/l) and won't pool up if leaked. It will simply rise as long as the bonnet is open because it is less dense than air, which is mostly much heavier nitrogen (1.25 g/l) and oxygen (1.4285 g/l). My guess is that the practice of connecting recipient's ground to the chassis rather than the negative battery post simply protects from igniting some minute leakage from the battery itself. There shouldn't be any open spark sources when the car is started. Alternator, spark plugs, spark plug wires, distributor and alternator shouldn't openly spark if they're in good condition, and they're usually far enough from the battery anyways. The heat shouldn't be nearly enough even if for some reason the engine you're jump starting is hot. Hydrogen spontaneously ignites in the atmosphere at ~500 °C, under hood temperatures shouldn't go much above ~100 °C",

There are several different choices for the active ingredient (ethylene glycol, methanol, propylene glycol); mixing them in your engine (by refilling with a different type) is probably a Bad Thing. Putting PG in a system designed for EG might be a problem too, even if the system had been flushed (and there's no such thing as a perfect flush.) However, the real fun starts when you mix (or mismatch) the corrosion inhibitors. Just don't do it. Wikipedia has some decent information on the subject...

I don't understand how electronics work at all in a car, as you can probably tell, lol. Cheers in advance! :)",
      "answer": "The reason is that very little current is flowing into the body of the car and that current is only at 12 volts which is not enough to penetrate dry human skin. For example, if a person puts a dry finger across the terminals of a 9v battery, they will not feel anything (but if a person puts the battery to their tongue, they will feel a tingle). If current was actively flowing to the body of the car, then it would be a \"short\" and would cause the battery to be rapidly drained. To easily go through average human skin, about 50 volts is needed. If the person is sweaty, the number can be much lower. If the current is exposed to the blood very little voltage is needed. In one case a guy electrocuted himself with a 9 volt battery by connecting probes to each terminal, then holding each probe in a hand and piercing his thumb with the probes. This allowed the current to directly access his blood and go through his heart.",

Some multimeters have 4 inputs for more precise measurements using Kelvin Sensing . In handheld devices this is typically seen on LCR Meters. Voltmeter Mode In Voltmeter mode you must always perform measurements in parallel with the circuit being measured, the circuit is powered The basic functionality of the voltmeter is to measure voltages, potential differences across two points in the circuit. Virtualy all DMM's will have voltmeter functionality. On the representative device shown in the image, the voltmeter modes are selected between 9:00 and 1:00 on the clock face. The flat bar represents DC mode and the Wiggly Line represents AC current. Either mode can safely be used interchangeably (affecting only reading accuracy) provided the voltage ratings are respected.

The only reason I could think of for them being dimmer was that additional wire was being used to complete the circuit that was either too thin or much longer than the circuit should be. From there, I realized that I should check the fuses in the \"upfitter\" fuse/relay box above the driver's head (at least 12 feet of wire away from the chassis interior fuse block). The bottom fuse in the right column is for the coachbuilder's logo on the control panel - it glows red when the other lights are on and when the engine is running, but somehow the relay was stuck closed and it was feeding power back to the marker lights.

      "answer": "I would recommend you get slotted, but not drilled rotors. Regular rotors will work fine for typical track use. What is more important is the type of brake pad you purchase to go with your disks. The reason I suggest not getting drilled rotors is, they have a tendency to crack at the holes due to stress risers. They will not last as long as you'd like them to and will not give you much more performance than just the slotted ones will. The slotted rotors will provide space for allowing brake dust and such to be brought away from the pad, which keeps it clean and better intact with the rotor.",

      "question": "Change calipers on both sides?",
      "context": "Four months ago, I had a seized brake in the front left. The slide bearing was stuck and the outer pad was worn more than the inner (at the piston). I wasn't able to move the journals of the bearing by hand and used a tool to get it moving again. Since cleaning the bearings didn't help, I removed any rust / oxidation from the holes with sandpaper, cleaned them, and assembled new journals with lots of that special grease shipped with them. However, the problem is back again, and I'm thinking about replacing the entire caliper to get rid of the problem. Should calipers be replaced on both sides, though there's just a problem on one side, as it's done for tires, pads and rotors? EDIT: Car is a small Kia Picanto (BA) 2008, just made 100,000km The calipers seem to be a single, solid part, without exchangeable bearings (the \"hole\"). As said, I already changed the journals (the movable part inside the hole) with temporary success, the brake is now running hot again. Hardly noticeable at low s",
      "answer": "There is no need for replacing the callipers together, as they will be heavy on your pocket, the reason why the pads and rotors are replaced together is since they work in tandem and working by rubbing against each other. The callipers on the other hand float over the entire assembly so there is no real point of changing them. You might need to change them both there is a contamination in the brake fluid since there are chances they might block the piston so if one is affected the definitely the other will be affected. ( if you detect this issue asap then you can just bleed the system and you will not run into issue but if its too late then you need to change both) To put it simply if the callipers are not jammed then there is no need to change them together. Now in your case since your car has crossed over 100,000 miles , there will be similar type of wear on the other calliper as well , have a look at them once and then decide if you want to proceed changing them.",

      "question": "Is downshifting on hills harmful for non-trucks?",
      "context": "Possible Duplicate: Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear? Since the days of taking drivers ed (many years back). I was told that when you encounter a steep or extended downgrade, to conserve your brakes and help increase braking performance it's a good idea to shift from Drive to 2nd (at least on automatic transmissions which is all I've driven). Still, while the advice seemes valid and for the most part it's helped greatly every so often in winter on hilly areas, on a recent trip through upstate New York, I encountered numerous rural hills so steep and long that when I downshifted, I was hitting 3-3.5k RPM peaking at 4k even as I was doing 40mph and breaking heavily (but steadily) to keep the RPMs in check. Anyway my main question is that when you see those hills with the signs indicating trucks must downshift, is it also a good idea for people driving sedans and other non-commercial vehicles? The main reason I ask is because I've heard downshifting saves brake",
      "answer": "tl,dr: The short answer is no, with caveats. The longer answer starts with \"well, you can kill your car with anything if you try hard enough.\" Let's use specific examples of when you should use your transmission for engine braking: Waimea Canyon or Mount Washington. In either case, you are descending thousands of vertical feet at significant grades. If you were to ride your brakes the entire way down, it's highly likely that the brakes would overheat and become less and less effective until they were essentially useless. This would be followed by a loud crashing sound. In fact, at the Mount Washington Auto Road, they will not let you proceed up or down the hill unless you are in \"2\" on an automatic transmission vehicle. Caveat: when you intentionally put your car in a lower gear and drive down a steep grade, you are giving gravity control of your engine revs. As I say, it is sometimes important to use engine braking (we've discussed the benefits to fuel economy before). However, you are the driver of the vehicle so you have to make the call about how much is too much. A simple rule of thumb: the redline is still the redline. If your engine braking is pushing the limits of the rated engine speed, it's time to use the brake pedal and slow down significantly and, possibly, drop down another gear. Otherwise, you're going to break your engine in an effort to save your brake pads.",

For illustration (and I'm making these numbers up), at around 2000 rpm on the tachometer, and going 60km/h \"punching\" the gas causes the tachometer to hit 4500 rpm yet the speed remains at 60km/h. I would expect the revs to remain at a constant ratio to the speed, so I'm wondering what might be going wrong. My first suspicion is a problem with the clutch, but I was wondering how I may test this or suggestions as to what else it may be. The car I'm thinking of in question has only around 27,000 km on it, which seems like a very short lifespan for a clutch! Thanks for reading, appreciate any insight.",
      "answer": "It sounds like the clutch is worn out... You can usually tell by gradually applying the gas in the top gear, probably around 2,500 RPM, and the car should accelerate a little bit, but at some point as you press the gas further and further down, you will feel it release and the revolutions will shoot way up without road speed increasing. It basically feels like you have pressed in the clutch while it was accelerating... Can it happen on a car with only 27,000km on it? Absolutely... The first car I had I destroyed the clutch, put a brand new clutch in, and that one was doing the same thing you describe after another 12,000 miles. It just depends on how the clutch is operated. One of my current cars (it's now 25 years later) we bought new and just turned over 199,000 miles on the original clutch. Obviously, I've learned a thing or two since that first car. :-)",

Connecting them back to front shouldn't damage electronics, as your car should have protection against this sort of thing, but it is the key thing to check - just in case. An example I can think of might be - an aftermarket car stereo may not have surge/voltage protection and it may be connected directly to the battery, not through the ignition switch, so connecting 12v across it the wrong way may damage it. More realistically it may just blow a fuse or a diode. As commented below, this could damage batteries - I was purely talking about electronics. Look out for your batteries :-)",

      "question": "How do I apply dielectric grease to my battery?",
      "context": "I recently had a new battery installed in my 2006 Subaru Forester. The shop did not use any dielectric grease, just connected the leads to the terminal and that's it. What is the preferred method of application? remove leads, apply to terminals, connect leads do not remove leads, apply to terminals and leads",
      "answer": "Evaporated / sprayed electrolyte is corrosive. If you see corrosion on the battery posts, the leads, or in the vicinity, that's why. A layer of silicone dielectric grease over the exposed metal parts will protect them. I especially like to get some on the threads of screws in that area, to make sure they come apart easily in the future. You want as much metal-metal surface area as possible between the battery posts and the terminals. Remember V=IR, which says that as current and resistance increase, so does voltage drop. Resistance is proportional to the cross sectional area of the conductor. So, if you draw a high current through battery leads that don't have much contact area with the posts, you will lose a lot of voltage through that connection (as heat). So, if you want a really good connection between these metal surfaces, why would you put dielectric (non-conductive) grease in between them? Because these surfaces are not perfectly smooth. At the high points they touch, and at the low points there are gaps. Dielectric grease will get smooshed in to the gaps, keeping out moisture and electrolyte. You only need a very thin layer here, though. As metal corrodes it expands. This will push apart the metal-metal contact at the battery posts. So, good to have the dielectric grease to stop that corrosion, and good to apply proper torque to the battery terminal. The only times cars usually see heavy loads is during starting and immediately after as the battery is recharged. You probably won't see enough heat buildup in that time for it to matter much, until you the battery is old and you try to start on a cold morning. Then the voltage drop across the battery connection will be enough to make it difficult to start. (It's a much bigger deal with off-grid homes and RVs, where the loads are continuous and the power source is scarce.)",

      "context": "I have a 2014 Honda Pilot with 3600 miles on it. Historically I have always changed oil in my vehicles every 3000 miles, using good quality non-synthetic oil. Now this Honda has an \"oil life indicator\" and it reports the oil still has 60% of it's life left. The manual says I should change the oil when there is about 15% life left. This sounds reasonable, but is it? I plan on keeping this vehicle for a long time. Should I stick with my every 3000 mile habits or will the \"oil life indicator\" accurately indicate when the oil should be changed to prevent engine damage?",
      "answer": "To the Mechanic suggesting 3000 mile changes, that recommendation has changed considerably. Several articles and studies have been done disproving the necessity of the 3k change. On any vehicle in the past 10 years, owners should follow their manufacturers suggested intervals which is usually 5k or closer to 7k for fully synthetic oils. I'd argue that it does hurt to change your oil every 3k - it hurts my back to do it, it doubles my maintenance costs (at $35 for full syn + a good filter, that adds up if you drive 15k / yr like I do), and it doubles the amount of oil consumed, recycled and produced. According to Edumunds : If we had been foolish enough to follow Jiffy Lube's 3,000-mile change schedule (which is essentially the advice given by all quick oil change outlets and dealership service departments), the Fit would have undergone four unnecessary oil changes per year (assuming 15,000 miles per year of driving), wasting $369 and 15.2 quarts of perfectly good oil. Over five years of the car's life and 60,000 miles of driving, this would have amounted to $1,847 and 125 quarts of wasted oil. This does not include other \"upselling\" items at each visit, such as cabin air filters. I'll keep $1,800 every 60k. You should too.",

For example, on my car, I'm supposed to check the oil when the engine is cold. In asking you to check when the engine is hot, the oil will not be pooled in the oil pan. Instead, it will have been fully circulated to all the moving parts that badly need that oil to function. As a result, you'll be checking the oil reserve that remains in the pan. Note, this oil isn't extra. Among its many functions, oil is also carrying some of the heat load of the engine. All those hot moving parts get the oil in contact up to painful temperatures. An \"excess\" allows the oil to absorb more heat without burning completely away. The oil in my car leaves the block, passes through an oil cooler and then to the oil pan before circulating back into the fray.

      "context": "In my 2003 Opel Vectra, the cabin air smells of Diesel exhaust while stopped at e.g. a red light. The exhaust smell goes away when driving, and it also doesn't come back if I turn the ventilation off before stopping at a light. It's not temperature-related: it happens whether it's cold or warm outside, and also whether or not the engine has reached its normal operating temperature. It also happens whether or not the A/C function of the ventilation system is turned on. The car's windows are always closed. It seems to me that there is some problem with the car's ventilation and/or exhaust system. I'm fairly sure it's not a problem with the A/C itself as it's not a chemical odor but clearly an exhaust smell. Asking the dealer, he told me that the car has a Diesel-powered auxilary heater that engages when it's cold outside and the engine isn't warm yet. While that heater is working, the heated cabin air might have a weak Diesel smell. - This explanation would make sense to me if it didn't ",

I'd try to open up the carb, check for deposit and clean it out with a good carb cleaner. If that improves matters but it's not quite there yet, I'd get the carb ultrasonically cleaned. The other potential issue that might contribute to the exhaust getting this hot is that the timing is off - check that as well.",

No - change the oil when the manual tells you the first one is due and not before. Some engines will be supplied with oil specific for running in and you actually risk doing more harm than good by prematurely changing it to the \"normal\" oil. Keep following the manual's guidance and enjoy your new bike!",

      "question": "Diesel vs Petrol motorcars. Pro&#39;s and cons?",
      "context": "I realize this may be a silly question to those of you on here who are proper petrol-heads and this may even be a repeat question, but I could not find anything on it on here, so here goes: What are the advantages and disadvantages between cars with petrol engines vs those with diesel engines? I've heard people say things like diesel engines produce more raw power, but are slower to get there. As far as I know, diesel engines need to warm up the fuel using the glowlamps (I think that's what they're called) before ignition is possible. When I was a kid (grew up in South Africa) only the pickup trucks were diesel-powered and diesel used to be way cheaper back then. I'm not interested in the inner workings of petrol vs. diesel engines, but more in what would be of relevance to an everyday buyer when choosing between diesel vs. petrol. I realize this question might be a bit broad, but I'm looking for differences one can expect (in general) between modern petrol- and diesel-powered motor ca",
      "answer": "As an everyday buyer you won't be interested in the high performance end of diesel or petrol, so here goes: Diesel engines typically rev lower and have more low speed torque - so you are less likely to stall off the line, for example. Petrol engines usually rev higher and get more power at 3-4 thousand revs Diesel seems to be getting more expensive - especially in the US. Diesel engines often run more efficiently - more miles per gallon (sometimes significantly more) Diesel engines are noisier, although manufacturers are improving all the time. In the UK you pay less emissions taxes on diesel engines, as the tax is heavily based on CO2, not particulates. So from a pure running cost perspective, diesel engines in cars are currently looking very good.",

      "answer": "There are multiple firing orders for some engine configurations, especially in the V8 realm. A Ford smallblock fires 1-5-4-8-6-3-7-2, while the same displacement modern modular Ford V8 fires 1-5-4-8-7-2-6-3. There's a huge wiki about Firing Order which contains a vast number of workable arrangements, even across the exact same cylinder configuration. To answer your specific question, firing order is usually decided to minimize potentially destructive vibrations and mechanical forces that would result if the torque pulses on the crankshaft throws were to harmonize. A similar note is that you will always find engines with a number of cylinders that is evenly divisible into 360 degrees of crankshaft rotation. 4,5,6,8,10,12 are all fine. 7,11 and 13 are not. The exact explanation is beyond me, but it has to do with vibrations and orders of harmonics in combination slider-crank mechanisms.",

Is there a known reason for this? Their smaller engines utilize overhead cams, but the larger V8 engines continue to use pushrods (Gen III/VI [LSx] and Gen V [LT1] Small Block).",
      "answer": "Car and Driver asked this very question to GM's Sam Winegarden, chief engineer for small-block V8's. The advantages of a push-rod valvetrain mentioned in the article can be summarized as follows: It allows for a more compact engine layout The camshaft sits in the \"valley\" of the engine, making use of free space. Because the engine doesn't have to place the camshaft above the cylinder head, the overall dimensions of a push-rod engine are both shorter and narrower. A more compact engine dimension frees up precious space in the engine bay and helps keep the vehicle's center of gravity low. It results in a lighter engine All else equal, one camshaft will have less rotating inertia than the two or four camshafts found in OHC designs. Fewer parts in the valvetrain = less weight. It costs less to build Fewer parts in the valvetrain = less cost. The article mentions an estimated $400 saving per engine.",

Almost half (49%) were the result of mechanical failure, leaks, or worn out parts. Electrical issues caused 23% of the fires.

      "answer": "I'm by no means an expert, but found an interesting article on Wikipedia about the W engine that indicates the W being a relatively recent addition to the automotive world, but not the aircraft/motorcycle worlds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_engine Three different configurations have been called W engines: Three banks of cylinders sharing a common crankshaft, a configuration also known as broad arrow configuration due to its shape resembling the British government broad arrow property mark. Four banks of cylinders sharing a common crankshaft, also called a 'double-V'. Two banks of cylinders with two crankshafts. [...] The classical W engine uses three banks of cylinders, all connected to one crankshaft. [...] One of the first W engines was the Anzani 3-cylinder, built in 1906, to be used in Anzani motorcycles. [...] The 1917 Napier Lion aircraft engine was an early W12 engine. Most of the rest of the article calls that the W engine, and calls the Veyron engine a double-V (specifically a double-VR6) engine. Looks like double-V started becoming known in the 1930-40 range. There's a mention in that article of a couple double-V (W12 and W24) aircraft engines becoming known about then(in addition to DucatiKiller's mention of the Auto Union Type-C). That Anzani 3-cylinder is the first mention that I could find of a W. As far as that W engine, it does look like what you were mentioning (3 cylinder banks) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzani_3-cylinder_fan_engines. The Napier Lion looks like that too.",

      "answer": "I would like to drive the car to the nearest qualified service, but there is a fair distance to it (about 8km) as I'm living in a remote location. Is it safe to drive it that distance if I refill the entire coolant tank? I would say yes, you can drive the car. Load the car with much more water than you think necessary: I find that two liter soda bottles make excellent transport and pouring vessels for this sort of thing. While driving, watch your gauge: if you see a high reading, get out and add water to the overflow tank (never open a hot radiator cap). Repeat as necessary. What can the cause be? I know that is impossible to diagnose a car without seeing it, however, if you have any idea what could the problem be, I would really like to hear it. The water is clearly doing what it is supposed to do: carry heat away from the engine. Unfortunately, something is preventing the heat from leaving the water (e.g., sludge as previously mentioned, fouling in the cooling fins or just impeded airflow) or you have a leak. I think that your instinct to go straight to a service station is a great idea. If, however, you were to choose to try to diagnose this situation yourself (which I'm not recommending if you're not feeling confident), you could try running the car up to temperature, turning it off and listening and looking for a pressure leak (hissing and / or white steam). For clarity, never never never feel around for a steam leak with your bare hands. Best case: you'll get a terrible burn. Following up on that last paragraph to add this lovely quote from Dan: Clouds, and the visible \"steam\" squirting out of a kettle or a steam locomotive, are liquid water droplets with a ceiling temperature of 100°C at sea-level air pressure. It's possible for actual invisible-vapour steam to be swirled in with condensed droplets as it mixes more or less chaotically with the outside air, but \"pure\" steam is invisible, and has no ceiling temperature.

[Edit] From http://www.ford-trucks.com/forums/369700-what-exactly-causes-the-diesel-noise.html The Loud knock is caused by the introduction of high pressure cold fuel into very high cylinder pressures. Now, who's right?",
      "answer": "The engine operates on high compression to ignite the fuel at very low RPMs which gives it it's distinctive sound. The lower RPM makes the ignition of each cylinder easier to hear and the compression ignition system gives it it's rattle like sound. This is as opposed to gasoline engines that operate by a spark/compression ignition system. The key to understanding this lies in understanding the diesel engine. See: the Wiki page for this. In short, the distinctiveness of your typical diesel sound comes from a combination of it's properties of low RPMs and the high compression ignition system. The actual sounds are generated at combustion and the opening and closing of valves. You really cannot hear the injection of the fluids into the chambers. Also, as another poster first pointed out (DucatiKiller), there is sometimes a piston slap that make a audible sound but not always in newer engines. Piston Slap The high pitch hiss noise you hear from some diesels as they accelerate comes from the turbo charger turbine spinning up and sucking in air at a high rate. Don't mistake the hiss I refer to with the air-brake system, as this is altogether something else. See:How a Turbo Charger works.",

The idle RPMs will be at 1000. After the car has heated up, I notice the idle RPM drop by about 250, and the steering wheel/car begin to rumble and shake. If I keep my foot on the brake and then tap the gas just enough to raise the RPMs back to 1000, the shaking stops. In neutral or park (it's an automatic vehicle) the shaking diminishes but the RPMs do not rise from 750.

      "answer": "I have a similar problem and haven't been able to figure it out yet, but here are the things I have tried and plan to try in the future. Some have helped marginally, some not at all, but they might work great in your case. If I left anything out, I'd love feedback! First thing to check is the engine and transmission mounts. If the engine shakes they are likely bad and need replacing (regardless of whether they are the cause or just a symptom) and that might fix your problem right there. An easy way to check the mounts is to have someone run the car while you're watching the engine with the hood open. Have the person rev the engine up and change between gears. If the engine jumps up and down at any of these actions one or more mounts is broken and needs fixed. Next, make sure your computer is not throwing any codes. If it is, this could save you a LOT of time. This case is usually hard to miss since it is (at least on my car) always accompanied by a check engine light on the dash. Spark problems: check your spark plugs or just outright replace them. Check your spark plug wires for resistance below 20KOhm and check for spark. Check the compression in the cylinders yourself, unless you trust the previous owner. No real reason to do all other hard work if this test fails. Dirty injectors/fuel system: try fuel system cleaners, see if that makes a difference. If it does, but not enough, you might need to do more serious work on the fuel line and injectors. Dirty/bad air intake components. Clean your throttle body, valves (especially the IAC), someone even suggested a full scrub of the whole intake manifold, something that is probably worth it anyway if you have the time (this is one of the things I plan on doing soon). Also check for vacuum leaks. Measure the ripple voltage that's coming from the alternator. Use the AC setting on a multimeter across the battery to do this while the engine is running (do NOT disconnect you battery while the car is running though!) Check th",

      "answer": "Generally, in the automotive world, there are two different types of dynamometer (or dyno for short) which might be used: chassis dyno; engine dyno. I'll discuss the general procedures for each type of dyno. Every dyno operator has their own procedure and will operate it how they see fit. You have to allow for this mainly because it's their dyno, they paid for it, and they have to pay to have it fixed if something goes wrong. Let them do their thing and you'll be golden. You'll find by reading this answer, though, you may want to ask questions of how they do operate their dyno to ensure you get the best (and most accurate) results possible. Chassis Dyno As I wrote in this answer there are several types of chassis dynos. I won't rehash that here. In general, a chassis dyno is the type where you drive your car onto it to get the readings. To get the most accurate readings from the dyno, you car should be fully warmed up to include the drive train. I've read that there can be as great as 1.5% increase in the power/torque readings between a cold drive train and one that is fully warmed. It's also a good idea as a dyno test is very stressful on an engine and vehicle, so having it warmed up only makes sense. The first thing you'll do (after you've found they dyno you're going to use and have set the appointment) when you get to your dyno appointment is to pull up onto the dyno equipment with your drive wheels on the roller. The operator will either have you do it and guide you where to stop, or they will do it for you. Once the vehicle has been correctly located onto the roller(s), you should then set the e-brake, turn the ignition off, and pop the hood. The operators will then set to placing tie down straps to hold the vehicle in place as well as placing chocks on both side of the non-driven tires. They will also place their electronic measuring equipment on your vehicle, such as a sensor off of your sparkplug wire to get engine RPM and a ground wire. If you've opted for",

      "context": "We've all heard this tip - \"start with the wheel furthest from the brake master cylinder and finish with the closest one\". Why? Does the sequence really matter? What exactly happens if we don't keep this sequence? Does this tip even apply with modern systems, such as double circuit diagonally split brake systems? ABS systems?",
      "answer": "The sequence matters. If you have a lot of air right after your master cylinder for whatever reason, that air can travel to any point in the system. At some point, the hydraulic line attached to the master cylinder will branch to each of the four wheels. As you pump the brakes, the air will propagate down the hydraulic line, and randomly go down one of the branches towards one of the four wheels. If you start with the wheel closest to the master cylinder and bleed it until there is no air, and then move on to the wheel furthest from the master cylinder (just as an example), as you're pumping the air out of that longest branch you could realistically get more air bubbles in the shortest branch. You wouldn't even get that air out, because you've already bled that wheel and you think you're done with it. When you start with the furthest wheel, though, you minimize the possibility that you miss air bubbles. This is because when you move from the furthest wheel to the second furthest wheel, you now only have fluid flowing past three of the four branches. There is no fluid that is passing that fourth branch, so there's less chance of air getting in there. Here is a rough illustration: # Rough Image ------- | | | | <- Master Cylinder ------- | Closest Wheel -> ----| | |------- <- Second Closest Wheel | | 3rd Closest Wheel -> ----- | | | |--------- <- 4th Closest Wheel So, hopefully you can see via this illustration that if you are bleeding the 3rd closest wheel, there isn't any fluid flowing past the branch to the Fourth closest. However, when you are bleeding the 3rd closest, there is fluid flowing past the Second and 1st closest, meaning that you still need to bleed those when you're done with the third closest. Edit: As pointed out in the comments, you should always refer to your manufacturer's instructions for the correct maintenance procedure for this and any other maintenance you perform on your vehicle.

      "question": "Why do 5 and 6-speed transmissions typically need different gear ratios?",
      "context": "My 2013 Subaru WRX has a 5-speed manual, and I long for it to have a 6th gear when cruising on the highway. A friend has a 2012 Subaru STI with a 6-speed manual, and I noticed his car runs through the gears more quickly to achieve the same speeds. At 3300-3500 RPMs, shouldn't the WRX be able to achieve better gas mileage by keeping the same 5-speed gear ratios, while adding an additional gear to lower RPMs to 2800-3000?",
      "answer": "tl;dr: different gear ratios are a feature, not a bug. Some cars use more gears for acceleration, some use them for better gas mileage. You can't do both. At 3300-3500 RPMs, shouldn't the WRX be able to achieve better gas mileage by keeping the same 5-speed gear ratios, while adding an additional gear to lower RPMs to 2800-3000? You've exposed the classic trade off in transmissions. We want to get the spinning motion of the motor to turn into spinning motion of the wheels. Unfortunately, the engine has a maximum rotational speed (the redline is there for a reason). The gears in the transmission are really just multipliers in the rotational velocity equation. First, a picture: In this image, you can see that the larger gear A (being driven by the motor) is driving the smaller gear B (used to turn the wheels). Yes, I know that there are more bits after this gear but for the sake of discussion let's forget final drives, etc. In this example, you can see that each turn of gear A results in two turns of gear B. This translates to a gear ratio of 1:2 or 0.5. If you had this gear in your car, you could cruise at very low revs on the highway (but you'd never get up a hill!). Saying it again, in words: A low ratio gear will turn the car tires a low number of times for each engine rotation. A high ratio will turn the car times several times per engine rotation. Thus, a high gear ratio at the top end permits a high top speed. It also means that, at highway speeds, the engine revolves less per linear meter of road. Fewer revs == less gasoline burned per second. Note: sometimes you will about hear \"short\" and \"tall\" gears. Short gears are the low speed gears (with high ratios) and tall gears are for high speeds (with low ratios). This inversion of terminology is one of the great joys of trying to discuss transmissions. However, a high gear ratio has a lower mechanical advantage. This means that it's harder to accelerate the vehicle (tires have to turn faster to get the car to go",

      "context": "I have a 1984 Toyota Supra that is now exclusively a track car. The last round out we let some less experienced drivers take the wheel and they basically destroyed the transmission. Nothing but 4th gear works now. We've been making the rounds at some local junkyards looking for a replacement, but have yet to find one. I've seen that there are rebuild kits available online for a couple hundred bucks, but I'm a little scared of cracking open a transmission. I've nearly taken the entire car apart and put it back together including swapping out a cracked block, but the head and transmission are the two pieces I try to stay away from touching for fear of not being able to get them back together correctly. Given the fact that the transmission can barely be forced into gear and 4th is the only gear that works at all is it even worth trying to rebuild? And secondly, is rebuilding a transmission something that a non-professional should attempt to do on his own? And if so are there a lot of spec",
      "answer": "It's not something I've ever attempted, but I know people who have... The innards involve a lot of small springs, shims, etc (mainly in the synchros), and these can often have a habit of flying off when released! It is something that should only be attempted in a decent, clean workshop/garage so you can keep track of all the bits as you take it apart, and do so carefully. I suspect from your description that it probably isn't worth trying to rebuild as the gears are probably wrecked, but if you have the facilities it might be an interesting learning experience to try taking it apart - I imagine you'll find some badly damaged gears and bits of teeth and swarf in the oil, but you might be lucky and find that it is rebuildable. Source another, then have a go at dismantling this one - if you get lucky and it can be rebuild, then you've got a spare next time someone wrecks it, and if not, you've not lost anything except your time.",

But I have this habit of putting the vehicle into neutral before approaching stops (red lights). The main reason behind doing this being, is to reduce the strain of holding the brake pedal. One of my friends is arguing that it's not good for the transmission system, shifting the transmission from D to N while the vehicle (with automatic transmission) is moving. I couldn't agree with him, as I couldn't find any issues with this. Also I couldn't find any information regarding the same on the manual for Toyota Corolla. Do you guys have any technical details about this? Thank you in Advance.",
      "answer": "Being in Neutral or Drive should have negligible to no effect on the distance the vehicle travels when the accelerator is not pressed because the torque converter disengages the engine below predetermined RPM levels. However, if you somehow were to push just a little too hard and sent the transmission into Reverse instead of stopping in Neutral, you would most likely be faced with purchasing a new transmission. Update: Rafi: If, by your question, you mean to say that you put the transmission into Neutral while waiting at a stop light, then this would not harm the transmission in any way. Though it will not harm your transmission to shift into Neutral while your vehicle is in motion, the additional wear on your brakes by leaving the transmission in Drive will be negligible over the life of the brake pads.

I have an older Porsche Cayenne Twin Turbo that does not come with an AGM battery. Is it always safe to replace standard batteries with AGM variants?",

      "context": "I had an engine shudder during my idle after startup yesterday morning. I checked my oil level and was a full X cross hatch height below the min oil line. I added 1.5 qts to get up to the max line. It made me curious how low does the oil have to go before the oil light comes on? Seems like I was 0.5 qts below min. UPDATE: the engine shudder was ultimately due to a clogged PCV hose that got replaced.",
      "answer": "The approximate answer for the cars that I have driven that take the standard 5-6 quarts is \"about 2 quarts low\". Maybe more, maybe less. Normally, you'll notice the light come on when taking a sharp corner as the oil sloshes to the side and the oil pump sucks air for a second. But, the major point here is that the light means \"low oil pressure\", not just low level. That's important because low pressure means oil is not pumping through the engine properly, and serious damage isn't far behind after that. When the oil is too low to cover the pick-up tube from the oil pump, it sucks air, resulting in low pressure and \"less than optimal\" engine lubrication (to say the least). If you see the light come on when taking a corner, find the nearest place to buy oil and add it. If you see the light come on when driving normally, pull over and turn off the engine as soon as safely possible. Don't drive the car until oil is added.",

      "question": "Does Vaseline dissolve rubber?",
      "context": "Recently, someone suggested that I apply some vaseline to an O-ring connection to see if I can find a leak. I've read that oil-based lubricants, especially vaseline, can desolve rubber. It seems like a bad idea to do this. Does vaseline (or any other oil-based lubricant) inherently degrade/desolve rubber? I think that neoprene o-rings are used in special places (like an A/C line) where oil is going to be present, just for this purpose.",
      "answer": "tl dr - Have no fear of Vaseline and o-rings O-rings are made out of many different materials. I would suggest that those o-rings which are made to work in the automotive realm are made to be resistant to things such as oil, gasoline, and other petroleum products. This would include Vaseline. While Vaseline and other petroleum products may degrade real rubber (actually made from the rubber tree), current o-rings technology does not use natural rubber. The Parker O-ring Handbook states: A polymer is the “result of a chemical linking of molecules into a long chain-like structure.” Both plastics and elastomers are classifi ed as polymers. In this handbook, polymer generally refers to a basic class of elastomer, members of which have similar chemical and physical properties. O-rings are made from many polymers, but a few polymers account for the majority of O-rings produced, namely Nitrile, EPDM and Neoprene. Emphasis mine. Looking further into the handbook will give you this matrix of how well different types of materials fair against different things: Looking throughout the matrix you can see that natural rubber does very poorly against oil, while Neoprene does fair to good and Nitrile does excellent. (Note: Even though EPDM is said to be used as one of the big three substances, I'm not finding it on the list.) With this in mind, you should have no worries about whether to utilize Vaseline on any of the o-rings. Vaseline is a very mild petroleum product. If it wasn't, we wouldn't use it in so many products which involve skin care. If o-rings were actually made of rubber, then there would be concern.",

Winter is coming though, and I really don't want to spend any time or money on tracking down leaks and converting to 134a and all that jazz. What I want is the simplest way to make the compressor stop spinning when the engine is on. Can I just cut/remove the belt? Could that have negative side effects? The compressor is on a belt by itself. It's the only reason I would consider removing the belt completely. Also, are there any significant advantages or disadvantages to removing a non-functioning A/C system entirely?",
      "answer": "Unless the compressor is on a belt by itself, you don't want to remove the belt. Water pumps, alternators and power steering are nice things to have. An A/C delete/bypass pulley for your application would be a way to go, but it will involve pulling the compressor. Probably the easiest thing to do is locate the appropriate relay and pull it. If it's the compressor making the noise and not the pulley/clutch, that should work. Otherwise it's pulley time. If the compressor is on a belt by itself, I guess you could remove the belt. I would still look for the relay and pull it, though. If it was my car, I wouldn't want to drive it long term without putting the delete pulley on. I would be worried the belt off situation was a corner case the engineers didn't worry about. Keep in mind that whatever leaks you have now are possibly going to multiply if you leave the system unpressurized for an extended period. Also, the compressor is engaged intermittently when you turn on the defroster to dry the air. If your windshield fogs up it will take longer to clear without the compressor.",

      "context": "I just did my first automotive AC repair, after the compressor in my 2004 Lancer 2.0 ate itself, cracked its casing, and blew all the refrigerant out. I think I did the repair & recharge correctly-- and the AC is blowing very cold-- but I'm concerned that the operating pressures are not anywhere close to what they are spec'd to be. (During recharge, I added ~18oz of r134a, per the yellow sticker under the hood.) Before recharging, I googled 'r134a pressure chart', and found the following: At the time, it was 82F in my garage, so I was expecting to end up in the middle of the range (both low- and high-pressure) for the 80F row.... 45psi for low, and about 190psi for the high side. (When referring to this chart, I assumed that the target low readings were for when the clutch was disengaged, and the target high readings were for when the clutch was active.) However, after my recharge the highest low reading I see (right before clutch engages) is 40psi, and the highest reading I ever see f",
      "answer": "That chart is not universal. You should be fine. Every model will have its own characteristic low-side and high-side pressures. This is why some manufacturers recommend charging refrigerant by mass rather than by high-side, low-side and ambient temperature values. As long as you have charged the system with the correct amount of refrigerant (which you have according to the tolerance defined in your manual), you should be fine. Another sanity check is that the low-pressure switch activates at 32 psi, which is lower than the 40 psi you are seeing on the low-side. I'm not sure if your Lancer is equipped with a high-side pressure switch but the same principle applies. Enjoy your ice-cold AC! P.S. Some observations about your procedure: Pulled vacuum to almost -30psi, observed that level held for 1 hour This tells me that there are no leaks. Added UV dye and 1.75 oz of PAG-46 oil to condenser The UV dye is added if you want to detect leaks with UV light. Else it shouldn't be necessary. PAG-46 is the right oil for your car and is absolutely necessary to since it lubricates the internals of the compressor. This car is 11 years old, and so the computer & pressure switch have about 160K miles on them. Not sure about the Lancer, but on some vehicles the pressure switch is a capacitor where the refrigerant pressure controls the distance between the two plates, thereby altering capacitance and voltage. Once again, the level of detail provided in this question is stellar. I'd consider this to be the golden standard for all AC-related questions.",

      "answer": "Smaller engines provide a myriad of benefits versus huge engines. Mainly it's fuel efficiency which also translates into emissions. The less fuel you burn, the fewer amount of gasses that get expelled from the engine. Not only that, but weight is something to consider as well. Space in the engine bay for more accessories is also something the engineers enjoy about it as well. You don't need huge 8 cylinder engines in regular cars anymore because engineering has come to a point where a 1.4L can push a huge car. It's all about engine design. You won't get the torque you would out of 6 or 8 cylinders, but for a daily driver that gets you from point A to point B; That's all you really need. Additionally, with the ever growing implementation of forced induction (Turbos and superchargers) becoming normal, horsepower and torque is more easily achieved in much smaller engines. I've seen little 2.0L that push 275HP stock out of the factory, which would be near impossible had a turbo not been used. Mainly though it has to do with fuel consumption and emissions.

      "context": "Although diesel runaway is not so common... ... the consequences are spectacularly catastrophic. On old-school engines, I can understand that there isn't much you can do about it except try to cut off the air supply. But what about modern engines? Since modern engines usually have a computer orchestrating between various sensors and actuators, it sounds quite plausible to have the computer detect the presence of a runaway condition and turn off the fuel injectors and (hopefully) avert disaster. Of course, cutting off fuel supply doesn't guarantee that runaway won't occur (if the engine is running on oil vapor) but it handles a possible failure mode. Questions Is it possible to define a logical condition based on certain engine operation characteristics (e.g. coolant temperature, speed, throttle) that would serve to represent an engine in runaway-mode? One important factor to consider is that the logical condition used should not give a false positive (e.g. it cuts off fuel supply becau",
      "answer": "The common way that effective overspeed protection is provided on diesels in the oil and gas industry is way more simple than using electronics to effect a shut down. The only effective and reliable method of shutting down an overspeed diesel is to block intake air. A simple valve is installed on the intake air passage which closes when air flow through the valve exceeds what would be normal for normal engine operating speeds. It is actuated by the air flow itself, it does not need any sensory inputs or external power. It can be configured to shut upon loss of oil pressure as an added feature (generally unrelated to overspeed), and to be shut manually by cable from the operating panel. These devices work on adjustable spring tension: the closing force on the valve is provided by the intake air flow passing through. As the air flow increases, the closing force builds up. this is resisted by the valve springs, the pre-load on which is adjustable such that at a given air flow the resulting force overcomes the spring resistance and causes the valve to close. once closed the valve will not reset to the open condition until the engine stops. API or NFPA (can't remember which) requires that mobile emergency response diesels used in the oil & gas industry (refineries), such as refinery fire engines, are equipped with hydrocarbon vapor detection that triggers the same valve mentioned above. I believe the primary reason is NOT to prevent runaway (even though it would), it's to shut down an active ignition source in a vapor cloud, which could be more catastrophic than a runaway diesel.",

Check the underside of the engine, if there are any possible leaks, any sign of liquid leaking from the engine bay one of the hoses might have leak (there are a host of things which carry fluids on a car so I cannot list out all of the fluid leak symptoms just check anything that is not water) Since you have mentioned it's a dealership there is a good chance of them cleaning it up so the other way to check is taking it for a drive and then checking the underside check the battery The multimeter/voltmeter will have two prongs sticking out red(+ve) and black(-VE) turn the middle knob to 12 or 20 volt scale, connect the prongs to the corresponding terminals on the battery the reading should be around 12.24 to 12.66. 12.66v . . . 100% 12.45v . . . 75% 12.24v . . . 50% 12.06v . . . 25% 11.89v . . . 0% Check the alternator: Again using the multimeter, follow this link for a detailed guide on how to check it, I am pointing it out here since a new alternator is cheap but the labour cost is massive. How to check alternator Check for any burnt smell (usually unlikely but give it a shot) Cold Start: DO this step in the beginning, have someone start the car and look at the exhaust; if you see lot of black smoke then you have problems. CEL check: Check for the check engine light; if it's ON then you have issues with the sensors or the ECM. Belts: have a look at the serpentine belt, the one which connects the compressor to the engine and alternator, check ",

      "question": "How do I troubleshoot the source of oil in my coolant?",
      "context": "I would like to know the step by step troubleshooting procedure for discovering the source of oil appearing in coolant. There are several different points of failure that can be the root cause for oil in coolant. What are the various points in an engine that could be the source of oil appearing in coolant? How do I rule out various sources of oil in coolant? What kind of tools do I need to troubleshoot the source of oil in coolant? How do I use those tools to determine the source of oil in coolant?",
      "answer": "Number one answer is always Head Gasket. The reason is that there are oil and water passages in close proximity, being separated by a gasket (which might just be flimsy paper or rubber, but is often steel or copper) sandwiched between two pieces of metal with (usually) different thermal expansion rates. This means that any time your engine gets far enough out of the proper heat range, the seal will fail and oil and water will begin to mix. Other problems will also result. The number two answer is \"oh, so you decked the block/shaved the head and replaced the head gasket... did you check the head for cracks?\" Again, it comes down to the fact that the head is typically full of oil and water passages and the head will typically be the loser (structurally speaking) when something bad happens in terms of overheating. The block does have both oil and water passages but they're much farther apart (the block is primarily concerned with oiling the rotating assembly and the piston walls while the coolant passages are on the outsides of the top halves of the cylinders). The third answer is a lot more car specific. Some cars (like the mazda bp) use a little housing that contains both oil and water flow to cool the oil with water. This almost never leaks, but it might be something worth checking out if you recently messed with it. Or maybe your car is equipped with a water cooled turbo... if the seals went bad, you might get oil flowing into the coolant that way. There aren't special tools beyond those required to take apart the engine. External oil leaks can be spotted via dye and UV lights but that won't work here. Oil in the coolant is usually a prime diagnostic tool for head gasket woes. If it isn't your head gasket, you'll already have the head off, so you might as well drop it off at a head specialist to have them check it for cracks and warping. The most common causes of bad HG I've seen (other than overheating) were improper torque, improper orientation of HG, use of gask",

I am currently in the far North country (Lithuania) could this have anything to do with cold winters (-20 C). The battery is 44B20L (Wet 12V 35Ah) capacity.

Still, this is something I have never seen yet...",

      "question": "Why is a 12V outlet that provides 120W protected by a 20A fuse in my 2015 Forester?",
      "context": "In my 2015 Subaru Forester, the 12V power outlet in the center console says that it is designed to supply loads that draw a max of 120W. To me, this would mean that there should be a max of 10 amps flowing through the outlet (120W/12V=10A). However, in the fuse box (and confirmed in the owner's manual) the fuse for the accessory power outlet is 20A, which would mean to me it wouldn't trip below 240W (12V*20A=240W). I would like to buy a power inverter such as this one for use in my car, and I would like to understand what really is the maximum load I can use this inverter for given the constraints explained above. My question essentially boils down to why is the 120W rating given for the outlet different than the fuse actually connected to it (240W)? Edit - Here's a link to an online version of my owners manual I found. The power outlet info starts on page 330 of the PDF (part 6-9 of the manual) and the fuse info is on page 505 of the PDF (12-10 of the manual). I will try to get a circ",
      "answer": "The purpose of the fuse is to limit the current in the wire to prevent it from overheating. That could cause the insulation to melt or even start a fire. The other components in the circuit will (should) also selected to handle the same load. So, for example, the accessory outlet should also be able to handle a 20A load. The bottom line is that nothing in the circuit should fail before the fuse. Since fuses are designed so that they will tolerate a small overload for a long time (hours or even days at around 5% or 10%) and to blow more and more quickly as the overload increases, the other components in the circuit should also have been selected with that in mind. The graph at the bottom shows the relationship between overload and time to blow (trip) for Littlefuse's automotive blade fuses. Without seeing a schematic for the circuit serving the accessory outlet it's hard to say if the rating is based on an abundance of caution or other loads on the same circuit, or maybe even a bureaucratic limitation. If you can find a schematic for the circuit, check to see if there are other loads. If the outlet is the only load on the circuit, or if the other loads are predictable/controllable (perhaps it serves a front and rear accessory outlet), then you can probably get away with it. Some of the thinking that goes into the rating of the outlet will be avoiding \"nuisance trips\" – having the fuse blow due to a condition which \"shouldn't\" blow the fuse. An example of this would be the current inrush that happens when a computer power supply is plugged in. One possible explanation for the rating might be that Subaru is being conservative – that's not a bad stance for them to take since inverters are typically rated for the amount of power they can deliver, not the amount that they consume. Since an inverter can't be 100% efficient it will need more than 240 Watts of input to produce 240 Watts of output. The current necessary to run the inverter will go up as the input voltage goes",

It will look for a park/neutral signal from the range switch and a crank signal from the ignition switch/Body Control Module. A break down of the starter relay terminals. If you pull the relay you'll see it's labeled on the bottom and has a diagram on the side. 85 - ECM sends power to this terminal to energize the coil. 86 - Grounded to the frame. 30 - Fused, always hot (B+ - Battery Positive). 87 - Goes to the starter solenoid. Pull the relay, check terminals 30 and 86 for power and ground. Be careful when probing the relay terminals if you can't touch the relay terminal with your multimeter probe don't try to force it in. Use a small pin or attach a male terminal end that properly fits the terminal to a piece of wire. Start with terminal 30, if you don't have power (12+v) on terminal 30 or if you have less than battery voltage check the starter fuse in the underhood fuse block. Ground your multimeter to the B- (Battery Negative) and probing the exposed terminals. Is there a difference in voltage between either post? If so replace the fuse. Visual inspections don't always reveal issues with fuses. If there is B+ voltage on terminal 30 move to the next terminal. What about terminal 86? Is it grounded? Check the ground point G109, is it clean and tight? How about terminal 87? When you probe the terminal it should be grounded since the starter grounds to the engine block. If it's not check the engine block to frame or battery connections. What happens when you jump power to terminal 87? Since you had the starter tested it should spin.

      "context": "It seems that everyone and their grandmother has a different color-code convention for 4-wire O2 sensors, which complicates matters when one is trying to wire up a replacement \"universal\" O2 sensor. Is it possible to determine signal-wire polarity on a 4-wire O2 sensor without relying on wire color-coding?",
      "answer": "No, you don't have to rely on wire colors to figure out what's what. With nothing more than a decent multimeter and premix flame (blowtorch or gas stove), a two-test sequence can reveal the identity of each wire, assuming the O2 sensor is fully-functional: Determine the heater wires This should be done first. These wires serve to heat up the O2 sensor to bring it up to operating temperature via a resistance-based heating element. To test, set the multimeter to resistance mode and use it to probe and figure out which wires register a resistance (usually 4-6 Ω). The two wires which register a resistance reading are the heater wires; the other two will show up as an open circuit or infinite resistance. As the O2 heater is resistor-based, polarity is not a concern here. Note down which two wires correspond to the heater circuit and proceed to Test 2. Determine sensor signal polarity The O2 sensor signal gives an indication of oxygen content sensed by the probe by sending an induced voltage that corresponds to the level of oxygen detected. However, this does require the sensor to be heated up to operating temperature. Necessary precaution must be taken. To test, set the multimeter to voltage mode and attach its probes to the two non-heater wires, noting which probe is negative and which is positive. Heat up the sensor's tip with the premix flame. Within a minute, the sensor should register a voltage in the 0-1 V range. If the voltage signal is positive, this indicates that the positive multimeter probe is connected to the signal wire and negative probe is connected to earth. If the voltage signal is negative, the multimeter probes have been connected in the opposite sense, so the negative probe is connected to the signal wire, while the positive probe is connected to earth.",

I did a little test where it I turned on the bright lights, AC, radio, rear defogger and opened the trunk so the light came on. At idle, my idle dropped from 750 to about 650, and the whole car was shaking. I made the following measurements with a clamp meter and a voltmeter: 12.34v at battery, 0.05 voltage drop between B+ and the positive battery terminal ( occasionally jumped to 0.1 ) 35amps at the alternator B+ terminal and -16 amps at the positive battery terminal ( i.e. the system was drawing 16 amps from the battery because the alternator couldn't keep up. ) I then had my wife raise the rpms to about 2300 and got 12.62 volts, with 58.7 amps at the alternator and -5.5 at the battery, meaning that it was still drawing from the battery due to the alternator's deficit.

      "answer": "So after separating the two halves of the alternator, and showing it to a guy who rebuilds alternators he said the stator looked like it was burnt and that maybe the field control unit might be bad also. Of course he only looked at it, although I have to say all the internal components do look burnt to my amateur eye and not just dirty: I also noticed a number of nicks and cracks in the insulation of the stator wires like this one: Now it quite possible that I caused these nicks and cracks in the process of disassembling the alternator, but the I was pretty careful I thought and it would seem the insulation isn't it such great condition if it chips off so easily. I tested the rotor, and the resistance between the slip rings was in spec ( between 2.4 - 6 Ohms according to one of my books ). I also re-tested the rectifier and it seemed OK, giving 525 Ohms at 24*C and 496 Ohms at 55*C. I'm not sure what's up with that, as I'm certain that I read 1199 on it a while back. So anyways, since the stator is toast ( literally ) I'm just going to grab an alternator either from the junkyard or look into a rebuilt one. Here's one more pick showing the back of the field control unit and the rectifier: I did try to clean the stator with some carb cleaner, but it didn't really seem to make much of a difference. Anyways, I'm going to chalk this up to a burnt rotor, unless anyone has a better guess.",

      "question": "Do these EBC brake pads look like a counterfeit?",
      "context": "I have purchased a pair of EBC Red Stuff front brake pads for my Audi S4 from a supplier whose name I will keep anonymous for now. I opened up the box and everything seemed in place except a weird feeling about how the brakes have been packaged and more importantly, how the actual pads looked like. The labels seemed very fragile to touch, and would start fading as soon as I lay my finger on them. I also found minor paint chips, which to be honest didn't bother me too much but I still noticed them. And finally, most important observation, the pads looked a bit different than what I have seen on other web sites. May I ask for some help from the community to help me identify if this is a counterfeit. I am attaching a few photos below.",
      "answer": "I went ahead with Abbottcost's advice and messaged EBC Barkes directly. They replied promptly with a detailed answer to my question. Here is an excerpt for the email: We only powder coat the rear of the pad so as not to get too much powder coat on the friction surface, this means the rough overspray can look a little untidy. The Brake-In coating is a thick and sticky and applied with a roller system so that can also look a bit untidy. The chip from the corner is nothing to worry about even if a part of the friction material has come away- this will not affect performance. Please see the attached photos which are of a set I took from the shelf in our warehouse which I feel are a match to the ones you have hence I’m happy they are good. So the answer is: YES they are very likely GENUINE. Thank you everyone for your input. I guess its better to double check than fall victim of counterfeit brake pads and learn it the hard way. Great support from EBC Brakes team too!",

I first thought that perhaps the transmission releases when the brake is applied, but why can I inch forward while applying my brake then? It seems like it would strip the transmission if it were trying to accelerate while braking. Thanks, Mac Edit 1: Thanks for all your responses, I now understand it! I don't think this is a duplicate, because the question on how a torque converter works doesn't include this question, and as a result I wasn't able to find an answer without asking a separate question.",
      "answer": "The somewhat longer answer is that the device that makes what you're asking possible is the torque converter. This device is a pair of curved blades setup as an impeller, and a turbine. The following cutaway pictures illustrate this setup: Here is a torque converter split in half for a better view: The way this works is explained really well by a You-Tube video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5G2zQ_3xTc Here is the gist of it. The turbine is attached to the engine and rotates at the speed the engine does. The pump is the other set of blades, and it is attached to the output shaft which goes to the transmission. The only connection between the two sets of blades is a viscous fluid (transmission fluid). At idle, the converter is in a phase called stall. No power is transmitted because while the turbine is spinning with the engine, which causes fluid to flow into the pump, the pump doesn't move because it is attached to the wheels which are held by the brakes. When you release the brakes, you move forward because the fluid driven by the turbine into the pump causes the pump to move which gets sent to the transmission. Bottom line, the reason this works is because there is no solid mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels. One of the links in that chain (the torque converter) only connects the engine to the transmission by two sets of turbine blades that face each other and are only indirectly driven by the force of moving the viscous fluid. Here is a link to a You-Tube video that demonstrates how the converter works using two fans. It really helps to visualize how the two turbine blade sets work together, and how the system works. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTfipsejqS0 I hope that helps!",

      "question": "Can a lithium-ion battery really start a truck?",
      "context": "There are some compact lithium-ion powered devices on the market that claim that they can start cars and trucks. Youtube is full of videos with reviews and people actually starting cars with them. And thousands of positive reviews on Amazon... Normally I'd buy one immediately, but given what I know about rechargeable lithium batteries, I just can't believe they are able to start cars. Someone did a teardown of one here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRqu-Iwd0g They advertise it as a \"1000A\" jump starter. Some are even rated for 4000A! In the video you can clearly see the battery is a rechargeable pouch lithium-ion 12Wh battery. Probably 3 cells in series with 2Ah capacity. How can a 3S lithium-ion battery do even a pulse discharge of 100A, let alone 1000A ? The highest discharge cell I've seen on the market gives like 40A. No car will start with 40A. It just doesn't sound possible. But somehow thousands of people can start cars with it. Am I missing something here? Did they patent s",
      "answer": "Yes, Lithium Ion batteries are capable of delivering the power required to turn over an engine. The thing I am most experienced with is the kind of batteries you put in remote controlled devices, so I will use those for reference. For all intents and purposes they are basically a consumer-friendly version of the bare cells you will find in the devices you are talking about. How much power (simplify this down to current, since current is a function of the power, voltage and resistance, and for all intents and purposes the voltage and resistance is relatively constant) a lithium ion battery can deliver is a function of how much surface area the electrodes within the battery have. How much voltage the battery has is a function of how many cells it has. Because more surface area = effectively higher current capabilities, a larger battery pack generally means a pack that can deliver higher current. The batteries discharge rate is measured as a function of its capacity as a results of this. A battery that is 10000mAh (10Ah) and has a 15C constant discharge rating - C standing for the capacity of the pack - means that the battery can be discharged constantly at 15 x 10A = 150A. In other words, you can buy a battery pack capable of delivery 150A at 14.8v off the shelf today from hobbyking (I can't suggest hooking one of the directly up to you car's battery, though). To add to this, the devices you are talking about aren't just a battery pack on it's own, they also include all sorts of charge circuitry and whatever else the manufacturer has put in them... as a result of this I would say it's safe to hazard a guess they aren't just battery packs like what I have described here (Even though we have come to the conclusion a battery pack on its own can deliver the power required for to turn over a reasonably sized modern engine), I would say they probably have a small capacitor bank alongside the battery. Basically, capacitors can deliver significantly higher sustained current, ",

      "context": "When trying to jump start my Volvo XC-60, I came across a very unexpected problem. I tried to use our 2nd vehicle, a 2010 Ford Escape, as the assisting car to jump start mine. But when I looked at the engine compartment of the Escape, I found that the battery is positioned in such a way that the negative terminal is completely inaccessible and there is no physical method that I can find to connect jumper leads to that battery. I was always taught to connect the jumper cables as follows: With + to +, and - on the assisting vehicle to a good ground point on the car with the dead battery. But given that the negative terminal is not accessible, I did not want to try it. I eventually borrowed a friends car to jump start mine, but now I'm left wondering, is it possible to use the Ford Escape to jump start another car by hooking the negative lead to another location?",
      "answer": "Any ground (earth) location will work. On my '06 Silverado, there are places to hook the jumpers which are away from the battery. You don't even hook the jumpers to the battery no matter which way you're going (whether jumping or being jumped). As long as you have a good ground location, you're golden. Given two vehicles with alternative connection points (places away from the battery), you could possibly have all four locations away from the battery and still be good. This may not be ideal, but it will still work. As an aside, I was always taught the vehicle doing the jumping should be the last vehicle to be connected, and that the negative on it should be the one which is connected away from the battery. Either way you go, the one which is done last should be the one connected away from the battery. This is because when the last connection is made, the inevitable spark will occur. Batteries release hydrogen gas which can ignite from the spark. By placing the last connection away from the battery, you severely limit the chances of an accidental explosion (think of flames and battery acid going everywhere ... not a pretty thought).",

      "answer": "The \"OD\" means over drive. It's the last gear in your transmission. When the indicator shows as \"off\", it means the transmission won't go into that gear. Overdrive provides a mechanical advantage for the engine to run at a slower speed when traveling at highway speeds. This allows for better fuel economy. As I stated, it is the last gear in the transmission and provides a better than 1:1 ratio. Depending on the car, it will be around .70:1 (or thereabouts). As far as whether it's on/off by default, you should allow the vehicle to achieve O/D whenever it wants to, which will allow the best fuel economy. It appears the button on your shifter is actually a switch. If you push it, it changes position and therefore the function it will allow. Since it does this, there's no real \"default\". If it were just a push button and the computer decides your actions, then there would be a default setting. Like I said, leave O/D on to operate normally. Modern vehicle computers are smart enough to know when to use O/D and when not to.",

You see them as prized possessions at SCCA gatherings to simple track days. The Wankel engine can be punished time and time again and doesn't suffer from the same weaknesses as the standard reciprocating internal combustion engine. As well, this car is light compared to it's brethren and when given upgrades it's power to weight ratio is hard to beat. My Questions: How can I make the internal combustion engine better? *What are some of the performance upgrades that really bring everything together? OR, simply put How do I get more overall horsepower out of this fantastic platform?",
      "answer": "I agree with your praise for this car, I had one back in the day and I have never loved a car as much since. To get more from this Wankel powered beauty, it's all about two things: Getting it to breath better Replacing parts that won't take the higher RPM The good news is that the only part that needs to be replaced, is the RPM gauge sender on the face plate of one of the rotors. It's plastic and won't take the additional rev's well. But, at the time anyway, there was a brass one available. So, getting it to breath better, there are a couple things here: Starting at the intake track, the stock air cleaner and carb need to go. there were downdraft kits available from Weber that really opened up the first part of the intake. There are also air cleaner kits available that have 360 degree openings that allow lots of air to get in. In order to get the air into the engine, you have to open up both the intake and exhaust ports. I'm not 100% on what the shape needed to be, I think it was just the same shape just make wider, but I don't remember at that level of detail. I do know that you needed to open up both the intake and exhaust ports. Speaking of the exhaust ports, the first thing the exhaust runs into here is a reburn chamber. The Wankel does not burn fuel terribly efficiently and this big bag filled with hot platinum was there to convert the raw unburnt hydrocarbons into something more emissions friendly. Unbolt it from the engine, and throw it away. Replace that burn chamber with straight pipe. There were several kits available from Rotary Engineering, but that was decades ago, and I don't know if they are even still in business. But what you need is an exhaust header that collects from the two rotors and brings hem to a collector, just as they would for a reciprocating engine. Put a more open exhaust on it next. From the collector to the tailpipe it was pretty easy to go straight from the collector to the muffler. There was not a lot under the car that got in your ",

      "context": "Why can some cars (mostly old Russian cars on YouTube) seemingly go through water while others can't? I'm talking about situations when the water level is at half the height of the car, so the engine is under the water. What are the differences between engines that break under water and those that don't?",
      "answer": "driving through water could potentially do a couple of different things: First off, if the water level is over the tail pipe, the engine rpm must be kept high in order to keep the exhaust pressure up, so that water does not go up the tail pipe and stall the engine. If this was to happen, it wouldn't likely do damage, but the car would have to be towed out of the water, and a modern car would likely throw a trouble code to the computer, causing the computer to have to be re-set. If you were able to drive through, then you didn't have this problem. If the water level gets above the air intake while the engine is running, the engine could suck in water, and the engine could hydrolock, which means that water is sucked into the cylinders. Because water does not compress like air, water in the cylinders can cause severe damage that will require and engine rebuild or replacement. If water gets in the engine while the engine is stalled, the water will have to be removed before the engine is started or a hydrolock could occur. Remove the spark plugs and crank the engine, and the water will be pumped out of the spark plug holes. If your vehicle hydrolocked, you would know about it, because it would make at least one very loud bang, and would not continue to run. Since most air cleaners are near the top of the engine compartment, in most cases, the water would have to be more than a foot deep to allow water into the air intake. Finally, if the water gets higher than the vents on your crank case, transmission, or differential, you could get water in your engine, transmission or differential oil. This would allow the vehicle to continue to drive, but over time, it could damage the vehicle. To check if this is the case, check the oil in each of these locations. if the oil on the dipstick appears milky, then there is water in it, and it should be changed. 4 years ago",

      "context": "This seemed to be most relevant site to ask my question. I am planning to purchase a new car and my shortlisted car has 4 speed automatic and 1.6 litre engine. The thing that worries me is that it has 4 speed instead of 5 speed which is very common in similar cars here, and for some reasons I cannot go for the manual, and the top spec 7 speed 1.8 litre model is outside my budget. I like everything about the car except the point in question. So my questions are: Will it limit top speed on motorway? (limit here is mostly 120 or 140 km/h) Will it limit acceleration, hamper overtaking etc? My search revealed that the 1.3 litre 4 speed automatic version is underpowered even within the city, but I have driven the 5 speed manual one and it was OK.

      "answer": "For a car that has 4, 5, 6 and 7 gear options, if all else is the same, then your top speed will be the same; all that would change would be your acceleration: In each gear you have a range where power is at it's highest. Below this gear speed your power is low (have you ever tried to accelerate in 5th from stationary?) And above it you hit the speed limitations of the engine. So having more gears means you can spend more time in the power band - so acceleration efficiency is improved, however this may be offset by the time it takes to change between gears. As an example, large trucks may have 12 gears - they need the power to accelerate heavy loads. But as the gear ratios are so close it takes a long time to get up to the top speed. The top speed itself has nothing to do with the number of gears. All that is important for the top speed is the power and max speed of the engine and the gear ratio of your top gear. So for question 1 - No Question 2 - probably the engine size/power Question 3 - far too broad a question to cover here. I'd suggest removing that one (you should only ask one question at a time)",

      "answer": "This sounds like a problem with the coolant temperature sensor. Don't worry - replacement is cheap and can be done easily by yourself or a friend who worked on cars before. Cause Cold engines need more fuel to start than warm engines. This is due to the fact that a part of the vaporized fuel condenses at the cold cylinder wall inside each cylinder. This part of the injected fuel is not available for the combustion process. Therefore, modern ECUs measure the engine temperature (by measuring the coolant temperature) and adapt the amount of fuel that gets injected during engine start and warmup. This is called warmup enrichment. If the ECU has no valid information about the engine temperature (due to a damaged sensor), the fuel mixture during engine start gets calculated incorrectly. This is not a big deal when the engine is running (worst possible side-effect: higher fuel consumption), but can prevent the engine from starting as the engine reacts more sensitively to changes in fuel-mixture during the cranking phase. The coolant sensor itself can be damaged, but the same kind of problems can arise from an unplugged sensor, from corroded contacts or from a damaged sensor wire or insulation. Fixing the problem Sensor replacement is very simple and can be done by yourself in 15 minutes: Let the engine cool down (otherwise you could get burned from hot coolant water) Remove metal clamp holding the sensor connector Unplug sensor cable Remove metal clamp holding the sensor Unplug sensor (this is the part when your hands get wet) Insert new sensor Install metal clamp holding the sensor Replug sensor cable Install metal clamp holding the sensor cable Here are three videos that show the installation process: Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 TL;DR: Check your coolant sensor.",

      "question": "How does ambient temperature affect engine efficiency and fuel consumption?",
      "context": "I remember from my physics class that the ideal-gas Carnot engine is more efficient if the temperature difference between the heat source and the thermostat (\"heat recipient\") is larger (http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/thermo/carnot.html). And I always thought that this MIGHT be applicable to real-life engines, so I have to admit, I did expect lower fuel consumption during winter. Alas, I have not yet experienced the money saving power of a winter's frost. But maybe my measurements were flawed, and combustion engines are indeed more efficient if excess heat is radiated more easily? PS: I know that a cold engine also means more viscous/thick oil. So I did notice a significant loss of efficiency (power, really) right after starting my motor. But I'm more interested in a stationary situation, when the engine is warm and ready.",
      "answer": "tl;dr: Ambient air temperature should generally not interfere with engine efficiency or fuel consumption, but will affect overall power output. Do not confuse efficiency with power output. These are two separate things. When your intake charge is more dense, you can throw more fuel at it and creates more power. (NOTE: The idea for the engine management system is to maintain a general 14.6:1 air to fuel ratio (also called stoichiometric or \"stoic\" for short). This is the so-called \"perfect\" mixture of air and fuel where all of the fuel is burned with no extra oxygen being left afterwards. Unfortunately, the stoic mixture is not usually obtained. This happens because of two problems which arise, both having to do with the amount of heat which is created during the combustion process. First, the hotter combustion can cause detonation. Second, above a combustion temperature of around 1700degF, nitrogen in the air which is brought into the engine (along with the oxygen -- air contains ~78% nitrogen and ~20% oxygen) and burns. This creates NO2 or Nitrogen Dioxide. This is a major air pollutant and was the primary cause of acid rain talked about in the 70's in California. It is also very bad for us to breath -- toxic in fact.) The flip side of this is efficiency, which in the context of engines means getting more usable power from the same amount of fuel. Great strides have been made in the past couple of decades towards engine efficiency. One of the ways they have accomplished this is through turbo-charging. In simple terms, turbo-charging is a way of utilizing the heat energy otherwise discarded in exhaust process. The turbo is able to increase the air charge by using the pressure created from the exhaust gases, which allows the computer to throw more fuel at the intake charge, thus making more power. This could lead to a very large \"other\" discussion, so I'll leave it here. Needless to say, power is made more efficiently through this method than through normal aspiratio",

      "question": "Why might I experience a power falloff after starting my car with the AC On?",
      "context": "I have a 2000 Chrysler Neon which generally runs well. I have noticed that if I start the vehicle, turn the AC on and reverse out of the driveway, the engine seems to struggle/sounds like it is going to stall. If I turn the AC off, it immediately regains power and runs fine. If the AC is off the whole time, there is no struggling/stalling behaviour. This also happens in a forward gear, but not to the same degree. Once the vehicle is running, I can turn the AC to full without this symptom, but it still feels a little less responsive. To give me an idea of where to start, what sorts of problems could cause these symptoms? Could it be an issue with the battery, since presumably it would be at its weakest immediately after starting?",
      "answer": "Air Conditioners are run by a belt that is connected to the crankshaft. The engine turning causes the A/C Compressor to move. When your A/C is not turned on, a clutch disengages the A/C Compressor's internals from the pulley on the belt. This allows that belt to free spin, not adding load onto the engine. When the A/C is turned on, that clutch is engaged and so the internals of the A/C Compressor are driven, this does add load to the engine. If this is a new symptom, then it is a sign that the compressor is adding more load to the engine then it used to and could be signs of a failing compressor, the pulley starting to seize, need for lubrication, etc. If it has always been this way and you are just curious as to why, it is simply additional strain being put on your engine by the A/C. The fact that it has more of an impact at first start then once moving is not surprising. Your engine is not warmed up yet and not at its optimal running condition yet. A/C systems impact the performance of all engines, however the smaller and less powerful the engine, the more impact is going to be noticed as the A/C systems are not proportional to the engine, they are proportional to the interior cabin space. Take a vehicle that has a 4 cylinder and 6 cylinder engine option, the A/C unit is going to be the same as there is the same interior space to cool. However, you are going to notice the power impact far less on the V6 as it will be a smaller % reduction of power.",

All I know to do is: 1: Open each cylinder. 2: Use a spark plug socket (with the rubber insert) to remove the old spark plug in each cylinder. 3: Insert new spark plug in each cylinder and tighten it (don't over-torque). 4: Close the cylinder back up.

Anything that I need to put on the spark plugs before putting the new ones in?",
      "answer": "They really are that simple - as long as you torque them correctly, there isn't a lot that can go wrong. They are designed to be as straightforward as possible - they don't require calibration, measurement etc. Make sure the connector is securely on the top of the spark plug, and make sure you don't get oil or grease on the contacts. And do them one at a time to make sure you connect the correct cable back up to the correct plug. You may even want to quickly test the engine running after you have changed each spark plug - this way, if you haven't tightened one up properly, you will be able to hear it straight away.",

      "question": "Why do the lights flicker when I accelerate?",
      "context": "I have a 2003 Ford Focus. Recently, I've noticed that when I accelerate (step on the gas), all the lights on the car flicker. This happens to both the dash lights in the car and the headlights outside. They will pulse bright and dim while I'm accelerating, and when I let up on the gas, the lights return to normal. What might cause this problem?",
      "answer": "There are three phases of a charging system. The charging system frequently will create AC current and diodes within the alternator will act as a rectifier and convert the AC current to DC where it can be stored in a battery. Here is a diagram If one or more of the diodes fails in the alternator you begin to see the pulse of the charging in your lights. It's especially apparent when two legs of the three legged system are down. This is what the waveform looks like The top wave is AC the lower wave is DC. If you you take wave 2 and 3 out and only have the signal from number 1 then you can begin to see why you have the pulsing affect. The reason it does it when you get on the gas is that your rpm's increase and the transmission and the engine engage, when you get off the gas most automatic transmission cars drop their rpm's and disengage from the transmission. Hence the pulsing while on the gas. Hope this helps, good luck.",

      "question": "What would happen if you shifted into reverse while you are going forward?",
      "context": "First, I am talking about manual cars and I know this is considered impossible because of the synchronized gears, but lets suppose that you can manage to shift gears (For example you could shift into reverse when stopped and then pull the car forward with another car, or even better, roll down a hill, always with the clutch) So, you are moving forward at a reasonable speed, for example 100 km/h, and then you release the clutch with the reverse gear engaged, what would happen then? My theory is that the engine would be forced to rotate the other way around, wouldn't it? Then, because of that, the engine would stop, and therefore it will \"generate\" a lot of force to the transmission and cause the car to reduce speed (all of this, if nothing breaks, of course) Is this assumption correct? There's a Myth Buster's chapter that tries this but with no luck on shifting the gear. Please try to avoid answers telling that it is impossible to shift into reverse when moving forward, as I stated befo",
      "answer": "My theory is that the engine would be forced to rotate the other way around, wouldn't it? Then, because of that, the engine would stop, and therefore it will \"generate\" a lot of force to the transmission and cause the car to reduce speed (all of this, if nothing breaks, of course) Put simply, in most cases, the motor will stall and the tires will lock. In some cases (enough speed or weight), you may force the motor to turn the opposite direction because reverse gearing is so low it would impart a high amount of torque to the input shaft, enough to rotate the motor in the opposite direction. This can happen with heavy trucks and vehicles pulling trailers. By putting so much torque in such a small amount of time (what is called \"Clutch Dumping\"), provided the clutch doesn't slip, you will destroy the transmission. The reverse gear was never intended to handle that much torque. However, (not recommending this in ANY way) if you were to put the vehicle in reverse gear with enough weight pulling it forward, or if you were to slowly release the clutch on a lower compression motor (most modern motors are very difficult to rotate due to their compression ratio) you could theoretically manage to rotate the motor in reverse. Would this cause damage? Perhaps not immediately except for the case of sudden shock to the internals. During extended operation, in engines with mechanical oil pumps, you would starve the bearings and motor of oil because the oil pump is now also rotating in reverse.",

      "question": "Car won&#39;t start after sitting for 2 years even with a jump. Is it a starter or alternator issue?",
      "context": "My parents have a 2001 Pontiac Aztek that's been sitting for two years. Apparently, before they stopped using it, there was an oil leak that caused starter problems (they couldn't find the leak), and they replaced it multiple times. And, the battery is as dead as dead gets...doesn't hold a charge to save its life. Based on the first part, I would assume it's a starter problem, but articles like this one: https://www.championautoparts.com/Parts-Matter/automotive-repair-and-maintenance/Car-Wont-Start.html, make me think the blame lies squarely with the battery, because it does turn over without any clicking or weird noises. However, it only turns over when hooked up to another car, but even after leaving it jumped for 30 minutes, it was still barely (slowly) turning over. The headlights are bright when I turn them on, while being jumped, but dim significantly when trying to start the car. Electronics seem to work, and the only warning light I get is for the battery. First question: shoul",
      "answer": "If the battery is completely dead, especially after sitting for two years, it most likely won't take a charge. Without the battery getting charged, you most likely don't have enough juice coming through the jumper cables to give it the power it needs to turn the Aztec over. Double check the voltage at the battery without the jumper cables on it. If it is still low (or non-existent), replace the battery. I would bet this will solve your issue. You'd have to be using some heavy duty jumper cables (I'm thinking 2-gauge or larger) to pass enough current through them to get an engine to start with a completely dead battery. Most regular jumper cables aren't anywhere close to this. As far as your second question about the starter/alternator going bad without any weird noises ... sure, but first things first. Change out the battery or get it fully charged, then work on separate issues. Usually, a starter and/or alternator will not go bad just sitting for long periods of time. Also, don't pay any attention to the battery light until after you get it started ... it isn't really stating the battery is bad ... it's there to tell you there's an issue with the charging system in general. If the engine isn't running, you won't be charging anything ;-)",

      "context": "Today I let my car battery charger charge a car battery over about 8 hours and probed the voltage to be about 15V with still 2 amps being pumped through by the charger (though the current was slowly falling over time) Is the battery damaged? The charger is a standard one designated for car batteries not an improvised one.",
      "answer": "I take it that the \"car battery charger\" you mention in your post is an old-school type, which does not have any built-in charge regulation? If it's taken your battery up to 15 volts, and it's a modern, regulated charger, it appears to me to be faulty. After 8 hours, no self-respecting modern charger should still be charging at 15 volts. If it's old school, this is pretty normal, and it's time to stop charging. So, to answer your question, Yes, 15 volts is too high. Most car alternators, that normally recharge your battery after every start, and provide power while the engine is running, are normally voltage regulated to about 13.8 to 14.0 volts. Up to this voltage and at normal temperatures, the battery will only gas very slightly. Above this, and it will gas increasingly with increasing voltage. This will damage your plates by causing flaking of plate material and shortening your battery's life. Gassing is undesirable. Note, by gassing, I don't mean boiling. Gassing is the breakdown (electrolysis) of water (H2O) in the electrolyte into H2 gas and O2 gas. This happens when the plates cannot accept any more charge (I.e. there is no PbSO4 left to be converted, meaning the plates are fully charged) if the voltage goes too high. A regulated charger will hold the voltage to 13.5 to 13.8 volts once the voltage has peaked, to prevent gassing and overcharging, and the current will drop to almost zero in a healthy battery. Gassing due to overcharging also \"uses up\" the water in your electrolyte, and in sealed batteries will fairly soon ruin the battery. You may have also noticed that the battery started to get warm/hot. This is another sign of overcharging, and is also damaging to the battery due to expansion and warping of the plates. CAUTION: This gas is a highly explosive mixture, so be very careful not to create any sparks near the battery while gassing continues, or for a while afterwards. Battery explosions are very nasty and dangerous. You'll get debris and acid flyi",

      "answer": "Got a 1998 Toyota Camry that has an empty battery and am wondering what the best course of action is. Why is it empty? Is it empty because the battery is old and dying and won't hold capacity? Or is it empty because you yesterday forgot the lights on? The correct course of action depends on the reason for it being empty. If the battery is good but you just forgot the lights on, and it has been empty only for a short duration of time (lead-acid batteries don't like extended deep discharge), then go ahead and jump start the car. That's the fastest way. You have to be careful when driving the car afterwards because if you accidentally misuse the clutch and cause the engine to stall, there's a risk you can't start it again. But with a little bit of care, you can drive it. If the battery is empty because it is old and dying, do not jump start it! The problem is that when jump starting, it is actually the donor battery providing charge. When you disconnect the donor vehicle, the only good battery in the electrical system goes away. The dying old battery in the recipient car can't act as a buffer for the electrical system. The alternator can then produce voltage spikes, destroying expensive electronic equipment all around the car. The newer the recipient car is, the more damage you will see. I would say 1998 car has enough electronics that you don't want to destroy all of them. So with an old and dying battery, you can try to see whether charging will remedy the situation. You can charge it slowly with a battery charger or rapidly from a donor car with jump start leads, but in that case don't turn the recipient car engine on. Then check to see whether the old battery is able to start the engine (with charger / jump start leads disconnected). If not, it's time to purchase a new battery. If it can start the engine, keep an eye of the situation and estimate when you need the new battery, if you need it at all. If you forgot the lights on, and then left the battery sit for a w",

      "question": "Is it normal for the oil to be dark in color right after an &quot;oil change&quot; in a 10-year old diesel car?",
      "context": "I took my 2002 Jetta TDI wagon to a neighborhood shop about 10 miles, 24 hours ago. They supposedly changed the oil, but the color is very dark, almost black. Definitely not light-colored/transparent. The oil change was performed along with other work (replacing alternator & brake pads). I'd run it back right away without a thought, but I'm wondering if this is normal for a 10-year old diesel car with 175,000 miles on it. Last oil change was made around 10,000 miles ago. The engine is original, too. Not sure if this is relevant, but I always have 5% to 99% biodiesel and Diesel Kleen in the fuel tank.",
      "answer": "It's a Diesel, which means that you usually have a high detergent oil in an engine that dumps combustion by-products like soot into the oil as part of its normal operation. Given the age of the vehicle I'm not surprised that the oil has noticeably darkened after 10 miles - one of the older Diesels I owned a while back did that during the time it took to run up the engine after the oil change and fill the oil filter. Also, when changing the oil, you'll never get all the oil out of the engine so the new engine oil will mix with a little oil that already contains combustion byproducts. This is nothing to worry about (it's usually a very small amount of oil that is left in the engine), but it'll also lead to oil darkening fairly quickly.",

      "question": "What actually happens when there is not enough coolant in a car engine?",
      "context": "I know that a lack of engine oil can destroy an engine, so I was curious as to whether it is just as bad to drive a car with a very low engine coolant. What is engine coolant? What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the engine coolant becomes too low?",
      "answer": "What is engine coolant? Engine coolant is a water and antifreeze solution. Because water has good properties as a coolant, antifreeze is used in internal combustion engines and other heat transfer applications, such as HVAC chillers and solar water heaters. The purpose of antifreeze is to prevent a rigid enclosure from bursting due to expansion when water freezes. As the coolant is moved around the system by the water pump, it passes through two main components: Radiator - The cars air intake is used to dissipate heat (which is easier across a larger surface area, higher fin density and thicker radiators - much like in PC water cooling). This is able to keep the engine coolant cool. Engine Block - This is the main part that the coolant is designed to wick away heat from, by flowing through engine hot spots and allowing the heat to transfer from the engine oil to the coolant as well in the process. What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the engine coolant becomes too low? Just to clarify, there are no tangible advantages other than saving a tiny amount of money on engine coolant. As you will see, you should never do this due to the knock-on effect that it can cause. Disadvantages Depending on the make and model of your car some of these may not apply, but in general: Water pump running dry - They will destroy themselves very quickly without water in them as they are not designed to run without lubrication and sufficient resistance (much like the pump in a water cooled PC). Overheating - this is the main disadvantage, but this can cause a huge knock-on effect in terms of causing other damage within the engine. These include but are not limited to the following: Seized piston - The piston will expand marginally due to the heat. As the engine uses such fine tolerances, this expansion can be enough to make the piston rub hard on the cylinder casing and make the crankshaft grind to a halt! This will be very expensive to fix.

      "context": "My largest car maintenance cost is exhaust pipes, mostly catalytic converters. I do not think this is the case for most people. What am I doing wrong? I tend to buy cheap cars (<£500), change the oil myself, get the brakes changed when they squeak and change the car if there are any repairs that cost more than the car. I do not drive slowly, such that I am not surprised that I get through tires and brakes a little quicker than other people. However by far my largest maintenance cost is exhaust pipes (mainly catalytic converters). It is always the connecting pipes that corrode and/or break, rather than the actual catalytic element. I do not see an obvious link between driving style and exhaust pipe corrosion, and I am not aware of any preventative maintenance that could affect the exhaust pipe. On one occasion I went through three in the course of 4 years on the same car, and in two of those cases there was very little corrosion, the pipe sheared above the catalytic converter. I live in",
      "answer": "Another cause of rapid exhaust system rusting is driving patterns which don't warm up the vehicle thoroughly. In this case, a \"thorough\" warmup means the entire exhaust is hot enough to cause all moisture within to evaporate. Depending upon the vehicle, this might take 10 miles of driving, the sort of distance necessary to warm the oil (not the coolant) to a steady temperature. If the vehicle is driven a lesser amount, moisture will remain in the system, and its presence will accelerate corrosion.",

      "question": "How does condensed water get sent out of an exhaust system?",
      "context": "We've all seen water dribbling out a car exhaust when we're following someone accelerating out of a stoplight. I know that the water is an inevitable product of combustion, but I find myself wondering how the liquid gets out of the exhaust system. You've all seen exhaust systems: the muffler exit port is never on the bottom of the muffler, but always on the side, with at least an inch of muffler below the lowest point of the port. Lots of water will condense in the (initially cool) muffler; how does the condensed water get out? The obvious answer is that the water pools in the muffler until it's that inch or so deep, but that makes no sense to me, as there'd be a half gallon or more of water in there most of the time. I've also never heard of someone pouring water out of a muffler when changing it. My next guess is that the car accelerating forwards causes the contained water to slosh out the exit port. But, then you have cars with mufflers mounted sideways: sloshing on acceleration cl",
      "answer": "If there was ever that much water in the muffler such that it was sloshing around, it would be a sign of catastrophic failure in the engine, such as a blown head gasket and the \"water\" would actually be antifreeze/water mix from the engine. However, my understanding of your question is that you're interested in the normal case of a few drops of water coming out of the tailpipe. It's actually a normal byproduct of combustion. Here's the chemical equation for the combustion of octane: C8H18 + 12.5 O2 --> 8 CO2 + 9 H2O From left to right, the compounds are octane, oxygen, carbon dioxide and water. (Note that real gasoline isn't this chemically simple and there are other byproducts including NOx, but this is sufficient to explain the concept.) Because the exhaust gasses are hot, the water byproduct is in the form of water vapor until it gets to the point that it's cooled below 100C (212F). When the engine is warmed up, that water vapor doesn't condense immediately and it escapes the tailpipe as an invisible gas. However, when the engine is cold, and if the ambient temperature is cold, the gas can condense in the tailpipe and comes out in the form of a few drops. With a normally operating vehicle, there are just a few drops and after the engine and exhaust are fully up to temperature, they cease entirely because the gas doesn't condense until it's already in the atmosphere beyond the tailpipe. Any water that happens to condense elsewhere in the system (e.g. the muffler) doesn't stay liquid for long because as the temperature rises, any liquid water is quickly reconverted to water vapor. For this reason, there's never any pooling of significant amounts of liquid in the exhaust of a normally operating vehicle.",

      "question": "Is it okay or useful to run heat and AC at the same time?",
      "context": "Most cars that I've seen in my life have a heat slider or dial, which goes from coldest to hottest, and also a button or switch that is labelled \"AC\". When the heat dial is set to cold, turning on the AC switch makes it even colder. I was under the impression that, when you turn on the AC switch, it basically adds a cold tube full of refrigerant in the path of the air, so that makes sense. But that would also mean that the AC switch would make heating less effective. Often enough, though, I see people with the heat dial set to hot while the AC switch is on. Is there any benefit to it? Would competing heating and cooling inside the same system cause any damage?",
      "answer": "You're meant to. In fact, in older cars, it was automatic when redirecting air to the window defroster. On this GM control, the far right position would activate the A/C compressor. Almost always, it is a cold, wet day, and you have both sliders all the way to the right. The pass across the activated A/C coils dries out the air, because of the way humidity works. So your window glass is immediately hit with dry air, and there is no need to wait for heat to become available. Later, as the engine warms up, the heater coil becomes effective, and now you are getting air that is pre-dried and then heated, which dries the air further. This dryness, moreso than the heat, defogs all your car's windows. Humidity and the battle for your windows The way humidity works is that warm air can hold quite a bit more water than cold air. That's why they talk about \"relative humidity\" instead of absolute humidity in terms of comfort. So if you have 10C/50F air, it won't have a ton of water to begin with, but if you chill it to 1c/34F, the water that's in it will condense out, and it will have almost no water. To the 50F/10C windshield, it will seem like very dry air, and the condensate on the windshield will evaporate into it. When you also start heating the air to 21C/70F, it is much drier still, and is even more effective on the windshield you are blasting. However, keeping condensation off the other windows is harder. Cars are poorly insulated and the temperature of the side windows will not rise much above outside temp. So if it's 50F outside, your air inside the car needs to be dry enough to be non-condensing (less than fully humid) at 50F. Outside air coming into the car is fully humid at that temperature, so it's no help at all. The A/C system is your secret weapon. Having driven cars without A/C, it is much more of a battle to keep windows clear when you do not have A/C available. It is not realistically going to happen until the car warms up, and even then you need heat blast",

      "question": "Why (almost) all dirt bikes have single cylinder engine?",
      "context": "Every dirt bike i know has a single cylinder engine. I myself ride a Yamaha XT660Z which has a huge 660 cc cylinder. What are the characteristics of those engines? what are the benefits of such design? Another interesting topic is that a lot of the engines used in dirt bikes are 2 stroke engines. What are the pros/cons of such engines compared to 4 stroke?",
      "answer": "The main reason for the use of a 2-stroke engine is it accelerates much faster than a similarly sized 4-stroke engine. The obvious reason for this is a 2-stroke cylinder fires on every revolution of the crank shaft, while a 4-stroke does it every other revolution. Also because the 2-stroke fires on every revolution, they only need enough weight to balance the engine. A 4-stroke engine needs added weight in the crank shaft to allow it to keep running during the non-firing stroke. This applies mainly when the engine is running in the lower RPM ranges. Due to the added weight, it takes the engine longer to increase speed from the lower to higher RPM ranges. These engines are also primarily air cooled. Having a single cylinder engine air cooled is a lot more efficient than trying to cool a two (or more) cylinder air-cooled engine. Air cooled is a simpler solution than is water cooled. A single cylinder engine is a lot simpler than a two cylinder engine, whether 2- or 4-stroke. There are just a lot less moving parts. There is no issue with why larger is better ... it goes back to the old saying of There is no replacement for displacement. Having more displacement, whether 2- or 4-stroke is going to provide more low end torque. Due to the way most 2-strokes fill the cylinder with air/fuel mixture, they are inherently less efficient than a 4-stroke engine is. The volumetric efficiency of a naturally aspirated 2-stroke limits its ability to make power. A similarly sized 4-stroke can fill the cylinder a lot more completely, allowing it to make a lot more power. For the edification of those who may not know, a 2-stroke engine only has a reed valve which functions as a check valve to allow for the correct air/exhaust flow. The inlet for the air/fuel is through low in the cylinder port(s) on one side of the cylinder. These inlets are at the position where, as the piston travels down in the cylinder, these ports are uncovered to allow the air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. ",

I'm trying to come up with an estimate of how much horsepower an engine wastes on things like the AC compressor, alternator, water pump, pullies, supercharger, etc. Edit: I realize it's impossible to say specifically since all vehicles are different and put different components on their engines drive belt. Prius and Highlander Hybrid have electric AC, for example, removing the compressor from the drive altogether. What about some general concept: So a typical small-to-mid-size car with: - Tensioner - AC - Alternator - Water pump - Power Steering pump HP required for each? In a medium scenario? In a large scenario? Answer thanks to @Scott and more research done: Small cars (e.g. Corolla, Civic, Focus): 15 HP - 25 HP. (typically have ~80 amp alternators, smaller water pumps, many with elec steering) Medium cars (e.g. Camry V6, Fusion V6): 25 HP - 40 HP. Larger cars (e.g. Traverse, Explorer, Mustang V8)",
      "answer": "Firstly, the comments made by others are correct. The power used by each of the components listed will vary on a component by component basis and even on an installation by installation basis. The power used by each component will also vary depending on the speed that it is running at. Also the number and type of components will vary from car to car. With that out of the way, here are some numbers that could be used for rough approximations. Tensioner The power used by the tensioner will be minimal and probably negligible. It will depend on how good the bearings are, but if it was using much energy at all, all that energy would be being converted to heat (or possibly noise). So tensioner can be pretty much ignored I think. AC According to Wikipedia's Airconditioner Article In an automobile, the A/C system will use around 5 horsepower (4 kW) It is marked as \"citation needed' though so take it with a grain of salt, but it would be approximately correct for when the aircon is activated. Remember that aircon is electronically clutched so that it's not always on and therefore not always using that much power. Alternator According to Zena Incorporated ... a 150 Amp alternator, operating at full output, the expected diesel engine load would be about 7-8 hp Like all the others this number should only be used as an approximation and note that a 150 Amp Alternator is a pretty large alternator. Also note that this figure is when 'operating at full output' it's pretty rare that an alternator is ever running at full output. Water Pump According to Davies, Craig FAQ Question No 19 Davies, Craig performed a number of tests which concluded that a normal water pump uses up to 10kW of power to operate at its high speeds. Be aware that Davies, Craig sell replacement water pumps that require less power to run so assume the numbers are only approximate. It's also worth reading through Question 2 on the same page where they describe how the power pulled by a mechanical pump that runs fro",

      "context": "I've got a 2.5 L engine here for which I do not know the performance specs (yet), because it's customized. I need to select injectors for this build, but there seems to be only one equation on the interweb to get the injector size, and this takes the engine's power in account, which I don't have. My idea was to calculate the maximum mass airflow that the engine will displace, and then calculate how much fuel gets mixed with that at the richest AFR I will ever maintain (12.05). Then dividing by max. duty cycle should give me the injector size. I took 100% VE at WOT. This is the result: Specific air mass: 1.27 kg/m3 Specific fuel mass: 0.75 kg/L Volume air flow: 6000rpm * 2.5L * 1/2 = 7500 L/min = 7.5 m3/min = 0.125 m3/sec (because 4 stroke) Mass air flow: 0.125 * 1.27 = 0.16 kg/sec Mass fuel flow: 0.16 / 12.05 = 0.013 kg/sec Volume fuelflow: 0.013 / 0.75 = 0.018 L/sec = 1062 cc/min Duty-Cycle 0.8: 1062 / 0.8 = 1328 cc/min This looks a bit too high to me...

      "answer": "Assuming this is for a naturally-aspirated application, your calculations are reasonable. I think you just missed dividing the value obtained by the number of cylinders. Usually 2.5 L engines have 4 cylinders and (subsequently) 4 injectors.

Recovery came out and got me started with a jump start pack (although the battery was showing 12v before). On the recovery guy's advice I replaced the battery. This morning a similar thing happened (dashcam and FM transmitter cycled on and off a couple of times shortly after I started driving), except after ~25-30 minutes of the k",
      "answer": "You may have a loose or corroded engine ground connection. The next time you have the electrical failure, leave the ignition switch ON and, using a voltmeter, measure voltage between the negative post on the battery and any shiny clean metal part that is bolted to the engine block. This should always read zero volts, or nearly zero. If it reads something like 12 volts, you have a bad engine ground which must be repaired. EDIT: To diagnose a bad engine ground without a voltmeter, you can use a jumper cable. The next time you have an electrical failure, connect a single jumper cable to the negative battery terminal (first) and a shiny clean metal part that is bolted to the engine block (second). Do not connect the second jumper cable of the pair to anything. If the car starts and everything works, this confirms the bad engine ground. For safety, keep the cable clear of moving parts such as belts, pulleys and fan blades, and do not drive with a jumper cable attached.",

      "context": "I have a 2001 VW Beetle which has a nasty habit of melting the above battery high voltage fuse box. I've replaced it three times already and replaced the alternator as well, but I'm at a complete loss as to what's causing the problem. Apparently this is a known issue with VW's from that era, there's even a class action suit against VW that's still working its way through the courts. Is there a real, permanent solution to this problem?",
      "answer": "As I understand it, there was a fundamental redesign in the cars from around 2002 onwards. Unfortunately that doesn't help you but I wonder if it is possible to retrofit the later model fuse box. Thank you for the picture, this has cleared things up. The fuse that has melted in your unit is S177 which is wired to the alternator. Apparently as the cable which goes from this fuse to the alternator gets old it begins to corrode, resistance increases as does the temperatures. The tried and tested solution amongst the VW guys and gals seems to be to replace this cable with some new, heavy duty shrouded cable to bring the resistance (and associated temperature) back down. The cable runs from this box down through the battery tray, around the back of your inlet manifold and to your alternator. Make sure you disconnect the battery before changing this cable and if in doubt, seek assistance from an auto-electrician.",

No problem with that, but then all of a sudden my front end was really jumpy. It was time to change the pads and rotors for my front disk brakes. Also, when I put all my weight and force on the brakes it definitely went to the floor with the pedal. I don't recall this ever happening, though I can't say for sure. Brake Change So then I changed both rotors and all pads for my front disk brakes. I noticed that my driver side pads had very little pad left (I changed these about 9 months - 12 months ago) and my passenger side had plenty of pad left. I would say drive side had about 1mm of pad left, and passenger side had 3.5 to 4mm of pad left. I also noticed something odd. When I was trying to compress the caliper piston on the driver's side caliper, it was extremely difficult. I eventually got it, but it wasn't nearly as easy as the passenger side. A",
      "answer": "It sounds like the caliper is sticking. If the piston is sticking then you would end up with one side worn down more then the other. Also, a piston should compress with a clamp, if it is that hard then that also points to it sticking. The smoking then could be from the pads being in constant contact with the rotor (if it is in that strong of contact). You probably would also notice the vehicle pulling to the side of the sticking caliper. Air in the line would not cause nor would a bad master cylinder.",

In this case, you remove the wires from the back and spin it to the proper location. You will want the sensor further from the pedal to have the lights come on earlier. Use a mirror or have a friend watch to ensure you have the proper adjustment and they do not stay on when you are not touching the pedal. In the case the switch is not adjustable, you have 3 options. Replace the switch with a new one to see if it is any better. Modify the switch. This can be done in 2 ways - shave down the top of the button head so the plunger is further out, or open it up and clean/move/change the contacts.

      "question": "Optimal RPM range for manual transmission",
      "context": "Are there optimal RPM ranges for different vehicles? I've been told it's better for the engine to drive at slightly higher RPMs (e.g. 2500-3000 for my Tacoma) than low (1000-1500). I understand a lot depends on the gear sizing and ratios for different trannies. E.g. the ratio between my 1st and 2nd gears is quite large so that, the RPM drop between those two speeds is almost 1000. That means, to avoid lugging when shifted into 2nd, I need to rev 1st up to almost 3000 RPM, which results in a less-than-pleasant engine noise. Is there an optimal RPM range for all speeds, which improves the engine longevity or is it speed specific? IOW, is it less bad to be lugging in lower speeds than higher? As a bonus question, can you explain why higher RPMs are better than lower, in terms of engine health, performance and fuel efficiency?",
      "answer": "It is in fact true that driving at slightly (key word) higher rpms is much better (for both fuel efficiency and engine life. The rpm range for the two can be different). Part 1. Engine life: Every engine has a least resonant rpm. This is when your engine vibrates the least (Think of this as the opposite of that point when your entire car begins to shake violently due to excess load). Since the vibration is minimum at this rpm, the wear and tear in the engine is minimized and so is the friction between engine components. This naturally means you have parts that run smoother and longer. This can also increase your fuel efficiency since frictional power loss is minimized. Part 2.Optimal fuel efficiency: This rpm range need not be the same as that for optimal engine life. Your fuel efficiency is best when you are not over working the car. This has multiple dimensions to it. Ideally, driving the car at a high gear, just shy of the midway mark on your tachometer is when the fuel efficiency is the maximum (i.e. when you are cruising) but if you demand acceleration you will burn a lot of fuel to get very little. This type of driving is best for the highway. In the city limits, it would be best to raise the engine to the sweet-spot (where the resonance is the least) and then shift to drop the rpm back down, all the while not being aggressive with the pedal. Low rpms give you better efficiency for two reasons, Dynamic friction is proportional to speed. (Higher the speed, greater the friction). This applies everywhere, from the crank shaft to the piston-cylinder to the gearbox. A car can rev only so much because after a certain point, the power generated is less than that needed to overcome the frictional force. Bottom line: Lower the speed, better the efficiency. Volumetric efficiency. (Higher the speed, lower the volumetric efficiency) At low engine speeds, as the engine goes through the exhaust stroke and the suction stroke, air can easily exit and fill the engine cylinder.",

Even if not, it most likely still has stored a fault that could verify that the Pressure Control Solenoid is faulty. The trouble code for this would be P1811 (max adapt, long shift). The component is located behind the side cover of the transmission and should take ~5 hours for a quality mechanic to complete.

      "answer": "I can't give you numbers or calculations without some work, but I can tell you than energy is never free. Cars have an A/C compressor that is mechanically driven by the engine because this is the easiest way to get the job done in a typical consumer car. An A/C compressor actually takes a huge amount of energy to operate. In fact a central A/C unit for a house uses more electricity than anything else (in a hot climate). If you want to electrically power the A/C that power needs to come from somewhere. If you wanted to generate enough power to drive an electric compressor, the required alternator would take even more engine power than the mechanical compressor because of inefficiencies and losses. If you wanted to use battery power, you would need very large batteries and a more powerful charging system. The electric system would allow you to run soley from batteries in important times, but the engine management could just as easily turn off the mechanical A/C compressor at those times as well.

He managed to get it going again with a jump start, but he wasn't sure how long he'd have to drive to ensure that the car would have enough battery to start again later. He ended up driving around for quite some time just to try to ensure that he was safe - but how long is really necessary?",
      "answer": "The question really is what the voltage was just before the jump start. A jump start is nothing more than get the engine running from another battery. If the engine runs again, the alternator/dynamo will charge the partly depleted battery again. Nobody can tell how long you need to drive to get the battery fully loaded again, as this depends on the state of the battery (old battery might need longer charging time), weather conditions (warm weather + warm engine = faster charging time), the !very dynamic! throttle position (high revs = more engine turns = more dynamo turns = faster charging), type of dynamo (big one = faster charging), electricity running from the battery (lights - A/C - fans - radio,..) , and finally type of engine (diesel engine = less load on battery while the engine runs = quicker charging). To make sure you get the battery all juiced up prior to shutting of the engine, you need to turn all electricity off - lights - A/C - fans - radio etc.. Then you could either leave the car running on the driveway, or take it for a spin. My suggestion would be to get in the car and drive for at least about half an hour - again totally depending on the depletion level - , while taking the things above into account. If you come back from your joyride -please- don't test if the car starts again and shut it off immedeately afterwards. This temporary huge load on the battery might leave it with just too less juice for your next start. Instead, just leave the car as is and hope the next time it will start again when you need to use your car :)",

In fact some of the longer lasting oils like Amsoil suggest you change your filter out at normal change intervals if you don't use their filters. The filter is very important in the scheme of things. While the oil may be able to stand up to the longer interval, once the filter gets full enough, it will start bypassing unfiltered oil directly back into the mix. This ensures your engine won't fail outright from oil starvation. It also means you have all of the dirt and particulates causing havoc within your engine.

It's the distillates which make up the usable parts. Crude oil is refined down to create lubricants and fuels through many different methods. This mainly happens by heating it and breaking it down into its usable components. Chemical engineers then take the oil and make it better. They will throw in additives to help it work better, to clean, and other such things we require of it. This type of oil is called regular oil or even \"dino oil\" (considering oil is considered to have originated from decomposing plants and animals which originated during the time of dinosaurs). When you look at a dino oil, it is not very consistent. When you consider an oil grade for dino oils, think of it as an average. I was once given this visualization of dino oil molecules: .oOoo..oOOoOo...o.o. Synthetic Oil Synthetic oil is man made. Chemical engineers take base oil stock and chemically modify it to create a lubricant which is more stable than dino oil, where operating extremes (such as high performance autos or jet engines) occur. This oil is tailored to have a controlled molecular structure with predictable properties. There are many different types of synthetic oils, made many different ways. In line with the above visualization of dino oil molecules, synthetic oil molecules might look more like this: ooooooooooooooooo To this end, there are three different categories of oil products: Organic oil - Dino oil. Regular oil. Crude oil which has been boiled. Semi-Synthetic - A mix of dino oil and synthetic oil. Can also be called synthetic blend or semi-synthetic. Synthetic - Pure man-made oil (no dino oil added). Oil Standards There are several standards in the world which pertain to oil. Some of tho",

      "context": "Does engine oil actually go bad from just sitting within an engine that's not getting use? I feel conventional motor oil has been sitting underground for millions of years prior to being extracted and refined. But I have a 1995 Mercruiser 350 (small block Chevy) marine engine with under 200 hours on it that hasn't had its oil changed since 2004. Am I doing significantly more damage to this engine by not changing the oil right now before running it this weekend?",
      "answer": "Short answer .... NO !! Now this is one of those seriously contentious topics that people will chime in from all walks of life, experience, and voodoo. I will speak [yell] my piece, and put on my Nomex undies: Oil goes \"bad\" from two things: The long chains get broken down due to wear. But ask any tribologist with an ounce of morals, and they will tell you that modern engine oil is sufficient to last MANY thousands of miles, perhaps 10-20K. (I get that you speak hours - I'm too lazy to translate that to knots.) And that's good old dinosaur juice. Modern synthetic compounds have wonderful properties, and might last twice as long as the organic stuff. In fact, with the exception of point #2, the right synthetic might last 50,000 miles. (x 0.868976 knots) BUT BUT BUT.... Oil gets dirty. Little particles of soot and combustion products and small insects and detris and debris and schmutz and water accumulate in your oil storage \"area\". A really good oil filter [e.g. Oberg] might filter down to 5 micron or less, but require frequent cleanings. Hence you only see this type of filter in racing and special applications. 2A. So what? Some of that dirt is abrasive. None of it is helpful. It is circulated under pressure. Now imagine that your very expensive synthetic oil is circulating little tiny abrasive bits all around those critical lubricated interface points. Doesn't matter how much the \"excipient\" [big word] costs, what you have created is a cutting fluid - no matter how expensive. The size of the little cutter buggers is only limited by your oil filter. And your standard oil filter is a balance between longevity and particle size. So So So? Oil gets dirty. (Did I yell that yet?) AND OIL GETS DIRTY AT THE SAME RATE WHETHER IT'S USED \"Wolfshead\" OIL FILTERED THROUGH WONDERBREAD, OR ULTRA-SYNTHETIC DERIVED FROM SIBERIAN ANT GLANDS AND COSTS $5000/ounce.

My exhaust pipe is welded on to each end of the CC on the G6 so I can't exactly peek inside. Thanks!",
      "answer": "If the cat rattles (may happen more after warmed up), then it's definitely bad. Banging on it can help see if there is material loose in there. If the cat was plugged up enough to affect performance, I would hope that one of the 02 sensors would kick off the check engine light. However, if it's borderline, I guess the engine may be able to adjust the fuel levels enough to make itself happy without adjusting enough to trip the CEL. To really and truly know, you'd have to check the back pressure ahead of the cat and compare it against factory specs. I've never had to actually do that though. Anytime I've had a cat plugged so bad that it affected performance, it caused the vehicle to outright misfire. All that being said, \"I feel that sometimes I have less power than I'm supposed to have\" is a really broad statement. Most things that affect performance on a modern car (enough to be noticeable) should trip the Check Engine Light and give you a place to begin troubleshooting.",

I have not yet measured the output temperature, but I'd like to know what to expect in a \"well-functioning\" system. From my research, it appears that a vent output temperature of 40°F to 45°F (4°C to 7°C) measured after driving for 10 minutes at 45+ mph would be reasonable on a 85°F (29.4°C) day with 70% relative humidity. Measurement would be taken from a console vent using a precise stick & dial thermometer. Is this so? Are there tables that would provide better diagnostic guidance?

It can take much longer on in hot weather or if the vehicle is parked in the sun. Measure at least 3 inches into the center dash vent. Temperature should be 40 to 42 deg F. Higher fan speeds, resulting in high air volume, will result in higher vent temps. Rear cabin systems are normally 10 degrees warmer because they have a larger volume of space to cool. The system is limited on low side temp by a thermo-switch that turns the system off at 34 degrees F. This is located in the evaporator. Given less than perfect heat transfer to the air about 40 degrees at the vents is the best it gets.",

      "context": "I would like to adjust four-body carbs by myself, in order to avoid spent money every time. What are the basic rules, tools and secrets of synchronizing multiple carburetor bodies?",
      "answer": "Background Multi-cylinder vehicles with multiple carbs To port this question over to applicability with cars. This is the same issue that has plagued older Ferrari and Jaguar mechanics over the years. The 'balancing act'. If you have a V12 and 6 or 12 carbs, getting them all balanced and uniformly restrictive in terms of allowing air into them can be very challenging. MOST multi-cylinder motorcycles have 1 carb or throttle body per cylinder. Late 70's through Early 2000 Multi-Carbed Motorcycles From the factory, your fuel screw is blocked by a small aluminum plug. You cannot adjust air/fuel ratio (AFR) on this bike until you drill out the plugs. They are very easy to remove. They are dangerous to drill out. If you penetrate through the aluminum plug you can push your drill down to the brass air adjustment screw and turn it all the way in. There is a needle at the end that will enter the air galley and get stuck. When you try and turn it out the pin snaps off into the air galley which provides proper AFR at idle and just off idle, since it's an air galley, it will be rich on that cylinder. AFR and carburetor synchronization They do interact and have some effect on one another. That being said, if you give one cylinder a super lean condition and the other a super rich one you can effect the synchronization. As well, the inverse is not true. If you have one carb set open too much and the other one closed off, their AFR won't change. Synchronizing - Tools and Tricks I understand some of the other respondents suggested using the water method with tubing going up a long piece of cardboard. That's not really for me. I've done back in the day but, I like to work on bikes and I worked for a real stiff chap that cut his teeth at HRC in the Pan-Pacific side car series with a works team. No junk tools, do it right. A tool like this is one that I recommend. *The big reason I recommend these is that they come with the brass or SS fittings that you need to screw into your manifold",

      "question": "How does intake manifold runner length effect the power curve of a car?",
      "context": "Recently I learned that a number of things such as the cam profile, compression ratio and the intake manifold runner length and volume can all effect the power curve of the engine. Here is an example of one. What exactly is the intake manifold runner length? What exactly is the intake manifold runner volume? How can the intake manifold runner length and volume effect the power curve of the engine?",
      "answer": "Intake manifold runner length is the linear distance from the inlet port (the face of the head) to a common point shared by all cylinders. Depending on the throttle position this could be the open atmosphere (if each cylinder has its own throttle butterfly) or a plenum (if they share a throttle body). The intake runner volume is the volume of that section of the inlet system, ie the cross sectional area multiplied by the length. The very short answer to the final question is that short, wide inlet runners move the torque curve up the rev range whereas long, narrow runners move the curve down the rev range. BUT - there is a whole lot more to it than that. The effect is caused by 'pulse waves', waves of relatively high and low pressure in the runner. The opening of an inlet valve causes low pressure at the engine end of the runner, as the engine sucks air out of the runner. Air starts to flow down the runner into the cylinder until the valve shuts, at which point all that air (travelling at high speed) crashes into the shut valve and creates a relatively high pressure 'slug' of air. This is reflected and starts to move back up the runner until the valve opens again, at which point it heads back towards the port. If the dimensions of the runner are calculated well, the high pressure 'slug' or 'pressure wave' will make its way through the port before the valve shuts again, when the next 'slug' is created. The dimensions are critical to the operating speed of the engine. If the runner is short, the reflected pulse might fall out of the end before the valve opens to suck it back in. If the runner is too long, the larger mass of air may react too slowly to perform well at high engine speeds. This is the reason car manufacturers have invented variable or twin length inlet manifolds, which change the dimensions of the inlet runners at a certain RPM to give improved torque across the engine's rev range.

      "answer": "Degreeing a cam is process for installing a camshaft and then verifying it's proper alignment with respect to the crank shaft. If a camshaft is being replaces due to damage or malfunction with another OEM camshaft generally the degreeing process is not performed. When the camshaft is installed a set of timing marks is lined up and this lines up the camshaft. The following is just one possible setup, every engine has a different alignment procedure. When installing an aftermarket camshaft for performance reasons the manufacturer specifies the correct alignment for that camshaft. The alignment of the camshaft is specified as crankshaft degrees when the cylinder number one intake valve reaches 0.050 inches of lift. For example 8 degrees before top dead center (BTDC). First install the camshaft and alight the marks available. Next rotate the engine to the top dead center of the number one cylinder. Next install the degree wheel, an indicator of some kind (a bent wire in this case) and something to turn the engine with (a crank handle in this case). Next adjust the engine to make sure it is exactly at top dead center. There are lots of ways and tool available to do this. I like a dial indicator. Adjust the degree wheel so that the top dead center of the engine, degree wheel and wire indicator all match. Now place a dial indicator on the number one intake lifter and rotate the engine backwards until 0.050 inches of lift is achieved. Once the lift is achieved the read the cam wheel. If this matches what the manufacturer specified then your all done. If it does not then the camshaft orientation need adjusted. This is usually done with a special gear or key way. For example, for this small block a special gear is available that takes inserts that offset the relationship between the camshaft key and the gear. This procedure is long and tedious with the need for attention to detail. I have generally glossed over the procedure. This was not meant as a comprehensive guide, it wa",

      "answer": "The port is badly broken, stop using it until you get it fixed. If it has always been like this, chances are the port is miswired so that the +5V and ground pins are swapped (perhaps an internal cable plugged in the wrong way round). The reverse polarity would almost certainly destroy any devices plugged in (there's no way to plug in any USB connector the wrong way round, so this is not a risk that device designers would normally protect against). On the other hand, if the port used to work normally and then started doing this all of a sudden, it's fairly likely the USB hub powering the port is toast and its 5V regulator is potentially letting full 12V+ through. Such an excess voltage will likely fry any unsuspecting device. The only solution would be to have the USB hub inspected and replaced.

      "answer": "These are some general guidelines when working with electricity on vehicles: Always remove any jewelry, to include rings, necklaces, watches, etc. If one of these items should come in contact between a hot and ground, it will instantly go hot (if there's enough amperage flow) and will burn into your skin requiring surgery to remove. These are a \"no matter what\" situation. There are also some physical reasons for removing these items as well. Disconnect the battery whenever working on anything which is voltage sensitive, such as the Engine Control Unit (ECU - vehicle's computer). This especially applies when working on the airbag system (SRS), though other precautions need to be taken there as well. Disconnect the battery whenever working on parts which need high amperage to operate, like the starter and alternator. These are items which, if the main power were grounded, would cause large issues for you and your vehicle. (Think thermonuclear meltdown.) Generally no need to disconnect the battery when changing out anything which involves low current or anything which is switched. That means it has no live wires going to it when switched off.

Simply fitting a bigger battery won't help, as it'll still discharge all the time you're using more power than you're generating. It sounds like you're already seeing the result of this even with your current lights, if they fluctuate with engine speed - you're only getting the full brightness when the alternator is turning faster and so generating more power.",

      "question": "Do cars ever use electric water pumps?",
      "context": "I saw this question in the cue recently. I know of no cars that are in production that use electric water pumps. I am assuming that it's continuity issue related to failure rates and engine damage risk. I believe this question is directly related to the electric oil pump question but felt the desire to ask to validate any misplaced beliefs I have. Does anyone know of a production vehicle that uses an electric water pump? If not, why not?",
      "answer": "The W12 engine produced by VW utilizes both mechanical and electric water pumps (underlined with green). According to VW's documentation: The cooling system of the Audi A8 with W12 engine is made up of the following components: Water pump in cylinder block/crankcase driven mechanically by Poly-V belt Map-controlled electrically operated continued coolant circulation pump -V51 as back-up for mechanical water pump and for continued coolant circulation There are more details provided on the electric pump: The electrically driven continued coolant circulation pump -V51 is located in parallel in the large cooling circuit in the return from the radiator. The continued coolant circulation pump -V51 has two functions: To provide back-up for the mechanically driven coolant pump at low engine speeds and to ensure adequate coolant circulation. -V51 is actuated via the additional coolant pump relay -J496 by engine control unit 1 -J623. Map control is employed to switch in the continued coolant circulation pump -V51 as required. The parameters used for this are the engine speed and the coolant temperature supplied by the coolant-temperature sender -G62. Switching levels: Cut-in: < 840 rpm and > 108 °C Cut-out: > 3000 rpm or < 106 °C To circulate the coolant during continued coolant circulation Continued coolant circulation is described as well: Continued coolant circulation Continued coolant circulation is regulated by engine control unit 1 -J623 in line with a map. Both the activation condition and the continued coolant circulation time are determined from the following parameters on the basis of an arithmetic model: Coolant temperature (from coolant temperature sender -G62) Engine oil temperature (from oil temperature sender -G8) Ambient temperature (from intake-air temperature sender -G42) The activation condition and continued coolant circulation period are constantly calculated from the time of starting the engine.

      "question": "How do I make all of this work together?",
      "context": "I have a friend with 1988 Jeep YJ. I'm not sure if this question is more appropriate for here or for Electrical Engineering. We want to mount this blender with an AC motor in it. I think it's 110 volts and 3.5 amps. We also want to put these 12volt DC LED lights around the base of it so it looks cool when we are out at the lake late at night fishing making margaritas. Plus, we can see what the margaritas look like when we are making them. Bonus. I would also like to mount my friends Jeep to the side of his house so we can use it as an AC generator. We need about 250amps I think. It needs to be able automatically couple into the house and connect a shaft through a radiator modification directly to the main pulley of the crankshaft of the vehicle. The engine of the Jeep will then drive an AC generator mounted in the wall of the house to power it. My Questions Will I need to ground the Jeep to the earth in order to prevent any safety issues? How can I convert the DC current from my batter",
      "answer": "How can I convert the DC current from my battery to power the blender in the Jeep? The only solution is a 12V DC to 110V AC inverter. Google is full of this, so I just linked google. Your blender has nearly 400W, so you should look for something in the 500W range to have some margin. However, this makes 400W/12V=33.3A, which is very unlikely to be delivered by the cigarette lighter socket. So you have to connect it directly to the battery. Use thick cables, and definitely a 50-60A fuse in the positive line, not too far from the battery. Also keep in mind that 33A is pretty much. I only have a cute 40Ah battery, so 30 margaritas, and not only me, but also the car couldn't drive any more. I guess your Jeep has a bigger battery and will last longer, and when you concentrate more on fishing, you'll also not make that many margaritas, and it will be fine. Will I need to ground the Jeep to the earth in order to prevent any safety issues? No. The reason for earthing is that mains also uses the earth as conductor for electricy. If there is a device with faulty isolation (i.e. hot wire connected on the case), you could close the circuit to earth and get electrocuted. By earthing the case of the device, current takes that way (and probably blows the fuse) These invertors should be completely floating, i.e. the mains they produce is in no way connected to their case, and so to the chassis. However, read the manual. Should I procure AC LED's or DC LED's for my blender lighting solution? Well, LEDs typically need up to about 3.5V DC, but as you said, there are 12V types, too. You could connect these directly to the 12V of your car. The longer leg / leg where the plasting flange is flattened a little needs to be connected to minus (chassis). I'm not aware of any LEDs which you can directly connect to mains voltage. However, it sounds strange to convert 12V DC to 110V AC, and this back to 12V DC to power the LEDs... In case you do NOT have 12V LEDs, you should connect each LED to ",

      "context": "I'm not having a good weekend - car wouldn't start, even when jump started using a conveniently placed 12v generator battery (almost identical to this question, I suspect dodgy cabling to the starter). The battery was fine at first, but various failed attempts to start the car and diagnose the problem and various other things have run it down. I'm trying to recharge the battery to properly test my theory that it's a problem with the wiring. I don't have access to a car battery charger and won't have access for several days, at least. As mentioned jumpstart didn't work. What I do have is a li-po battery pack designed for laptops, appliances etc that outputs at 12v, 16v and 18v (3.5 amps), which I can connect to crocodile clips and to the accessory socket. I double-checked with a multi-meter that the output was right and that the polarity was as expected before connecting. This didn't go as expected: Connecting to the battery while connected to the car, set to 12v, connecting positive to",
      "answer": "This battery pack is rated for 4A at 12V. But a really empty car battery can easily draw much more that 5A when connected to 12V, which is definitely too much for your battery pack. The LiPo battery itself can deliver lots of, but not unlimited current. At high currents, it can get really hot and even start a fire. The battery pack contains a protection circuit, which trips if the current exceeds a threshold. (The mains power cable of your house can deliver some 100A, but the cabeling in your house can not handle this - To prevent fires you have circuit breakers tripping at too high currents. The breaker doesn't care whether there's a short circuit or just too many devices connected!) The simple solar panel doesn't have this problem. You can easily short-circuit it, and it will just deliver its maximum current. It's a little confusing that the fuse of your accessory socket blows up. The original use of the socket is a cigarette lighter, and this is typically fused with 10, 15 or sometimes 20A. Either your LiPo pack is capable of delivering extreme currents for a while, or these sockets are not designed for cigarette lighters any more and are fused for lower current. And again, your solar panel does not deliver more that 0.2A at 12V (0.2A*12V=2.4W), and the fuse doesn't blow.",

      "context": "Please help me figure out if low RPMs on my daughter's 2005 Suburban 5.3 FlexFuel is the cause or a just symptom of problems with oil and fuel pressure. The problem only happens when the engine is warm and I think that’s because it runs 200-300 extra RPMs while the engine is cold. I am totally stumped and this ruined my Memorial Day weekend and I would love to read any ideas about what the problem might be, what is the cause vs the effect, or what I could try next. Background & Symptoms: Last Thursday evening my daughter said her truck was making a terrible noise and had no \"get-up-and-go.\" I started it but it sounded fine idling in Park. I put it in gear (foot on the brake) and heard what sounded like a bad engine knock or maybe shaking a can of spray paint except the can has multiple marbles. The sound stopped when I let my foot off the brake. I braked and the sound quickly returned. I put it in Park and the sound instantly disappeared. I rolled down the windows and turned off the AC",
      "answer": "The oil pressure thing is quite normal for the LS based 5.3L LM7 which is in her Suburban. This stems from the pump's pressure spring wearing out and/or the plunger it backs getting sticky in its bore. Best solution for this is to get a new oil pump and install it. While the oil pul isn't technically in the pan, I'm pretty sure you have to take the pan off in order to get to the bolt which holds the pickup tube on (I've only ever removed them with the engine out of the vehicle and oil pan off). As for the issues, check to make sure the battery is fully charged (at least 13+ VDC with engine off) and the alternator is charging correctly (~14.1 VDC running). If either of these are low, it could be your issue. The fuel pressure should be ~58psi. If the fuel pressure is low, it may be causing the noise you are (or were) hearing. Knock doesn't usually show itself unless there is a torque demand put on the engine, like it being in gear. Usually you wouldn't hear it unless you actually step on the gas, but if bad enough (as you were suggesting) it could be causing it to appear while at idle in drive/reverse. A very lean state can cause knock, which if the fuel pressure is low, there you go. Whether or not the engine is knocking, it sounds like the computer is picking it up as such considering what you were saying about it retarding the timing. While this isn't the real issue (retarded timing) it sounds like it's the issue which is causing it not wanting to accelerate. The computer can pull enough timing which will absolutely kill power. Since you aren't getting the noise in park/neutral, it will free rev without issues.",

I have always used DOT4 brake fluid with this, and another car of similar age, with no troubles. However recently I bought another brand of DOT 4 brake fluid whcih had the word \"Synthetic\" written on it. Hmm. I don't think my usual supplier's bottles has this word.

      "answer": "The information & links posted by Paulster2 offer excellent explanation of what the various types of brake fluid are. There are a few grade : DOT3 DOT4 DOT5 DOT5.1 The difference between them is a specificed standard regarding the boiling temperature, which rises as the DOT number rises, and amount of water absorption. There are based on two materials: Glycol based (\"traditional\" brake fluid) and Silicone based. DOT5 is exclusively silicone based because only silicone meets the criteria specified by the DOT5 standard. As regards mixing them: Generally this is a bad idea, but the main thing warned against is mixing Silicone based fluid with Glycol. This thranslates to not mixing DOT 5 with any other DOT standard fluid. However mixing for example Glycol DOT3 with Glycol DOT4 would give unpredictable performance. Nowhere have I seen anything saying \"this is ok\". I suspect the reason is that a mixture of formulations may give an unproven boiling temperature. One apparent red herring is the word \"Synthetic\" - Glycol based brake fluids may or may not claim to be \"synthetic\". This doesn't necessarily relate to whether the fluid is glycol based or silicon. In a nutshell : Don't mix the DOT ratings, unless you're adding a higher rating resulting in a raised boiling point Don't mix glycol based and silicone based fluids (ie don't mix DOT 5 with any other rating) Given that axiom, you can mix brands of brake fluid for the same rating/base material.",

      "answer": "Consider the possibility that the brakes make the noise at all speeds but that higher speeds mask it. The most likely cause is worn pads/shoes. You should check their remaining thickness against the manufacturer's recommended minimum. (Look in a repair manual if you have one, or search the Web.) Check the thickness of the brake rotors, too. If the car has been left to sit for a few days, corrosion on the brake rotors can cause brake noise until it is scraped off by the pads.

He thinks that it is impossible to maintain an automatic transmission box. Hence he is avoiding all cars with automatic transmissions -- I am very skeptical about this. What are the lifetimes of automatic transmission boxes and manual transmission boxes? By which actions you can increase the lifetime of an automatic transmission box? Is it more expensive to maintain a car with automatic-transmission than a car with a manual transmission?",
      "answer": "They will probably work out to be the same. An automatic transmission is inherently more complicated which means more can go wrong and usually does (more so than manuals). The increased complexity also makes them more expensive, heavier, less fuel efficient etc. A manual transmission is less complicated which means there is less that can go wrong. Through normal use a manual transmission should far outlive an automatic transmission with regards to absolute lifespan. HOWEVER, a manual transmission requires the use of a clutch which will wear out quite quickly relative to an automatic transmissions life-cycle. If you are not able to replace a clutch yourself (which requires removing the transmission) then you will be paying quite a bit more maintenance on the manual transmission every time the clutch wears out (anywhere from 2-8 years). With the automatic transmission there is less high ticket maintenance required besides fluid flushes. If your automatic transmission dies however then it will probably be at-least $1000 more expensive than the equivalent manual transmission to replace. So it probably depends how long he wants to keep the vehicle and whether he cares about having to replace clutches or is able to do that himself to save money.",

It looked something like the below: Image source If I were to have been jumping the dead car with another car, I would have given the dead car's battery a good long charge from the donor car before trying to start it. I am wondering, can one \"charge\" a dead battery by leaving one of these portable jump kits connected for like 10 minutes? Or are these jump kits meant solely to provide a enough juice just for a jump.",
      "answer": "As Miracle Max would say, there's two kinds of dead batteries, and there's a big difference between them. Mostly Dead This is the most common kind of dead battery. Let's say your battery is rated for 300 cold cranking amps. After several years of use, it degrades until it reaches, say, 250 amps. Your battery isn't out of power, it just can't get your engine over the hump of cranking amps. Incidentally, in this scenario, \"letting the battery charge\" won't help because the battery is no longer capable of holding sufficient charge. Jumping in this scenario works by borrowing the remaining amps from an external source. This is why even a small car can often jump a large pickup. You can even buy battery chargers that can plug into a wall and will give you that boost as well (both batteries and wall chargers do this via a capacitor). These smaller jumping batteries are designed to give you surge in cranking amps for a single moment to give you that extra push. Depending on the device, that could be as little as 100 amps or as many as 2000. All Dead After you've gone through the battery's pockets for loose change... wait, we're talking batteries. Sorry, Max. An \"all dead\" battery is really a good battery that is mostly or fully depleted (i.e. you ran your car radio with the engine off for a long time or your alternator died). This is a less common problem, but it still happens. A pure surge battery isn't designed help you directly with this problem because it's generally designed to offer a one-time boost. Your lead-acid car battery really wouldn't like getting 500 amps all at once. Lead acid batteries like a slow, steady charge. Most wall-powered chargers run 15-30A in charging mode and you'll need to charge it for some time (meaning several hours) to get it back up to full. If I were to have been jumping the dead car with another car, I would have given the dead car's battery a good long charge from the donor car before trying to start it.

      "question": "Why use a car battery charger?",
      "context": "What's the need for car battery chargers that I often see on display in auto parts shops? I mean a battery is sold charged (and if it discharges too much it just dies and can't be restored) and every car has an alternator for charging the battery and if the battery is empty and can't start the engine then jump-starting is not a problem. So any usable battery can be installed into the car and fully charged there. What are the scenarios for using those chargers? Why and when would one use such charger?",
      "answer": "Why and when would one use such charger? To my mind, the major needs fall into two major categories: You have a vehicle that does not get driven enough to keep the battery up to charge against its passive drain. Common examples would include the summer-only car or the utility vehicle that you only use for heavy hauling. In either of those cases, I would tend to hook up the battery charger at least an hour before I really needed to drive the vehicle, just to avoid the potential frustration and delay. You have ever had a battery fail on you (or worse, your spouse). Traditionally, this is when most of us tend to buy a charger: immediately after a battery failure in a high stress environment. It's important to remember that a sudden dip in temperature (e.g., below freezing) can suddenly illustrate that a battery you thought was fine is actually not able to cope. I have a relatively cheap charger (item 2 above applies to me). It was a relatively cheap purchase, especially when you consider the stress avoidance factor. It is not a more expensive battery conditioner that a higher income person than me would leave connected to their summer car's battery through the winter. It is perfectly suitable for bringing my parent's old truck out of their garage after a few months of disuse, however. EDIT: responding to sharptooth's questions in the comment: I'm particularly interested in the 2nd scenario. Suppose the car won't start and I jump-start it and then buy a charger. How do I use the charger then? Do I charge the battery once and forget or what do I do with it? You're going to have to make a judgement call. Is this a fairly new battery that died after a month of sitting out in the cold? Or is this an older battery that should have worked but for some reason did not have enough juice to get you going? Or somewhere in between? In general, the time when I'm most likely to use a charger is when I am in something more like the second situation. I charge the older battery up to fu",

      "context": "I've recently started having a bit of trouble with my car. I typically drive my car to and from work each day. A couple weeks ago I went on vacation and when I returned, my car battery was as dead as could be. The battery was already a couple years old, so I went to the local auto parts shop, purchased and installed a new battery. This morning, after it had sat through the weekend, it wouldn't start and was completely dead. I drove the car at lunch, and it started without any trouble. Furthermore, other than the incident a couple weeks ago and this morning, I haven't had any form of trouble starting my car. It's always started quickly, without any trouble. I checked how many amps the care was pulling while it was off and it was .78 amps. Could this slowly kill my battery after a few days or is that a normal power draw for a car that isn't running?

      "answer": "Not sure what it \"should\" be pulling, but anywhere near a whole amp is way too much and will drain the battery in no time. Are you sure you tested right? Often the pull when you first connect the battery can be a lot higher than the steady pull since you might be charging some capacitors, etc. If it stays that high you definitely have a problem, possibly a partial short.",

      "answer": "Upon the regular engine starting key turn area the dash lights dim and there maybe a single 'tch sound or no sound at all coming from the engine block. Sadly, I know this sound well. This sounds like a dead battery. Here are the steps that I would suggest: Charge the battery with a plug-in battery charger. They aren't terribly expensive to purchase (this same problem is why I have one). You might be able to get a loaner / rental. If the battery can take a charge, drive the car for a while near your home. Stop the car in your driveway. Count to ten. Try to restart the engine. Repeat step 3 until your confidence is restored. Here are the things that I'm trying to help you diagnose: Is the alternator dead / insufficient? On my car, a primary indicator would be the volt meter dropping steadily as the battery discharged. Is the battery dead / incapable of holding sufficient charge? Remember, batteries are a consumable part. Their lifespan is variable as well: in general, three years is still youngish but seven years is old. Are the connectors bad? You did mention corrosion on the connectors (which is more likely a chalky substance).

      "context": "I was discussing where to buy car batteries with a friend who is a professional driver and who has briefly worked as a mechanic. He suggested buying from one particular shop for several reasons, one of which was that they have a high turnover of stock and that therefore the batteries haven't been standing as long on the shelves. The shop I'd been thinking of going to, he recommended against because selling car batteries is only a small part of their business and he expected the car batteries to be in less than ideal condition from having been in storage for a very long time (years, potentially). Does this reasoning make sense? I thought car batteries only degraded and discharged when left connected for long periods, and so leaving them boxed and unconnected would not be a problem. A few clarifcations: These are all the \"maintainence-free\" sealed type of lead-acid battery It's worth mentioning that this is Sierra Leone, West Africa, and most car batteries on sale are Chinese or Nigerian",
      "answer": "All batteries have a self discharge rate. This comes form the inherent nature of their chemistry. Lead acid batteries are one of the worst offenders when it comes to their self discharge rate. The estimates are all different but between 5% and 20% of capacity discharge a month is the general consensus. Because the discharge rate is a function of current capacity the discharge is a decaying exponential. The battery will go flat eventually but the less charged it is the slower the rate of discharge is. Allowing the battery to discharge while in storage is not inherently bad. What is bad is allowing a lead acid battery to go totally flat, ie 0V. This is where the damage comes from. If the battery didn't go below roughly 9v I would not be concerned about its health.",

      "answer": "Recycle it. Don't use it for anything, it's an environmental hazard. Just get rid of it in the least impactful way. Used motor oil has a plethora of bad chemicals and compounds in it that eliminate for another use once it has been inside your engine for an extended period of time. Aside from the hydrocarbons there is lead, phosphorous, berium, zinc, bromine, aluminum, arsenic, calcium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, potassium, silicon, sodium, tin, toluene, benzene, xylene and ethylbenzene among others. Here's a link from the CDC. Most auto parts stores in Western Europe and N. America will allow you to pour into their waste containers for free and a service company will pick it up for recycling and reuse for other purposes like door hinge lubricant. The most socially conscious and morally responsible action is to recycle. There is also Nietzsche's argument that we all have a moral obligation based upon our innate contract with society when we are born to what is best for our society. Most philosophical disciplines would drive to a moral standard that states you are obligated to recycle until there is a better less impactful solution that comes about through the evolution of technology. This also provides a great example for those that surround you. Young or old, our behaviors are inherited from others and recycling is a great behavior to pass on to others.",

I am planning on flushing the system with distilled water a few times. But it seems to me that if I add a 50/50 mix of fluid back after the last drain, all the water left in the heater core will dilute the 50/50 mixture even more. So since they say about half the liquid remains in the heater core after a drain, that I should add undiluted pure antifreeze to the system. That way it will mix with roughly half the water in the engine with the pure coolant I put in. Does this sound correct?

Depending on total volume of coolant (different for each vehicle) how much pure AF I put in, anywhere from 1/2 to 1 gallon, then top off with 50/50 mix.

First, more PB Blaster, and then while I was at the auto parts store getting parts for another project, I spotted these and decided to try them: On the package they say \"Reusable\" but on the store's web site they say \"Disposable\" so my hopes weren't really high. However, I used it and it did the trick. Essentially, it's a 6-point adapter that fits into a 12-point box-end wrench 2mm larger than the target size. So for my 13mm bolt, I used a 15mm wrench. It's sufficiently low profile that it was able to fit where more conventional extractors probably wouldn't. The result I tried the first one and was elated when it actually broke the nut free, so I tried it on the second one, where it promptly cracked into pieces. Still, it seemed to me to be worth the $10 that I paid for the set, so I went back to the store and bought another set. As you can see from the picture above, the second nut was also removed and was tightly lodged in the extractor. I was able to remove the nut eventually, but there is now a significant crack in the side of the extractor, which leads me to conclude that I haven't many uses left with this one. So my conclusion is that these are better thought of as \"disposable\" than \"reusable\" although some reuse is probably possible. Copious amounts of penetrating oil and the German opera on the radio probably both helped, but the tool did what I needed and I consider the price worth the avoided headaches of alternative means.",

Why do cheaply manufactured cars come like that, what kind of gain putting the cat right after the manifold can the manufacture make other than having shorter wires for the o2 sensors? Or am mistaken and those cars come with two cats like I have seen in some other cars?",
      "answer": "The main purpose of putting it right after the manifold is heat. The cat functions best when hot. Placing it as close as possible to the manifold helps the cat heat faster and stay hotter, which produces better results in what it's designed to do: curb exhaust emissions.",

Also do mufflers provide back pressure and do sporty mufflers provide less?",
      "answer": "Pressure drop is to flow as voltage drop is to current With all else equal, removing the resonator or muffler will reduce the restrictions in the exhaust pipe. This means that the ability of the exhaust headers to flow gases will increase, not decrease. However, this does not necessarily mean that the engine will produce more power, since that is the result of several subsystems working together. So if the exhaust is bottlenecking performance, reducing exhaust restriction will improve performance until the point that something else becomes the weakest link. If something else (like air intake) is already the weakest link, a better-flowing exhaust system will have little impact on power. Vehicles that employ wideband lambda sensors are sensitive to backpressure; they can tolerate deviations up to a point, but beyond that the engine may run too rich or too lean.",

Is/how is it different for different engines? (car, motorcycle) How does it do it? I'm most curious about my 4-stroke carbureted 125cc scooter, but I expect it does basically the same thing across engine sizes (or does it?). Why do I want it? If I want to race, if I want to save money, etc? This should follow from #1, but I'm still curious about what the classic get-a-performance-pipe-if scenarios are.",
      "answer": "What does it do? (better performance [and how so?]? better mileage? cooler sounds?) It depends. One of the goals of a performance exhaust is usually to create a tuned system: A tuned exhaust system is an exhaust system for an internal combustion engine which improves its efficiency by using precise geometry to reflect the pressure waves from the exhaust valve or port back to the valve or port at a particular time in the cycle. Note that the focus on this sort of optimization is the flow of exhaust gas, not the elimination of noise. This doesn't mean that a well-designed system can't also be street legal but there's an excellent chance that, for common street vehicles, an exhaust system replacement will be louder than the stock equipment. Why do I want it? If I want to race, if I want to save money, etc? If you're not sure, there's a good chance that you don't want a new exhaust. This should follow from #1, but I'm still curious about what the classic get-a-performance-pipe-if scenarios are. To be honest, the most common story that I hear from people getting louder pipes is \"spent money, was louder, went slower.\" Here are some situations that have applied to me over the years: Muffler on normally aspirated car rusted out. Sourced a replacement cat-back system that claimed single digit horsepower increases based on the manufacturing company's racing efforts. The system used stainless steel so it was also less likely to rust and significantly lighter. In the end, I paid hundreds of dollars for a few horsepower and more noise (admittedly, it sounded really cool). Exhaust header on normally aspirated car lost an internal weld, turning the engine into Buzzy the Hummingbird. Replaced header with stainless steel (see above). Muffler on turbo car got really rusty. Replaced with stainless steel with better flow. Very modest boost in power from increased exhaust flow (more important in a turbo car). Replaced turbo up-pipe (the primary path of exhaust gas to the turbo's turbine",

My question is: would it still be safe to drive (to go to the shop to get new parts) with the exhaust coming out underneath the car (break is somewhere underneath the boot/trunk)? I may be a bit overly cautious but would heat from the open exhaust effect the fuel tank some how?",
      "answer": "You will likely be annoyingly loud but otherwise fine. As always, you are liable for your own compliance with local noise ordinances. I would recommend that you drive with the windows up until you give the car to the shop in order to avoid any risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. For example, don't drive with the trunk propped open: the low pressure behind the car will trap a bunch of exhaust back there and you don't want it coming into the car with you. The risk is pretty low but you'll feel better if you're already concerned. It's unlikely that the tank will notice any increase in temperature: it's used to being in the vicinity of hot metal carrying exhaust fumes. Now it's just going to experience the fumes directly. When I replaced my muffler some years back, I started the car with the muffler off and was seriously tempted to drive around making a huge racket without any concern about exhaust fumes.

      "question": "What Can I Learn From Exhaust Manifold Temps?",
      "context": "I was wondering what I can learn from the temperatures on the individual exhaust pipes coming out of each cylinder. The question is general, and my specific example is on my 98 Mazda 626 GF 2L. Last time I checked it was after revving the engine a bit and came out to 416, 426, 362, 308 in Fahrenheit. The EGR pipe is connected to exaust cylinder 4, the coolest one. The hottest cylinder is always 2, the coolest always 4 and the difference between them is usually about 70*-100*F.",
      "answer": "Generally when an engine runs, if it is running lean, it will run hotter. If an engine is running rich, it will run cooler. Each individual cylinder is no different. After an engine is completely warmed up, if one measures each cylinder at the same basic place on the exhaust manifold, you can get an idea of which cylinder is running lean and which is running rich in comparison to each other. On the GM LT1 (Gen-II Small Block) ECU, there is a table in the ECU called the Individual Cylinder Fuel Trim Multiplier. I don't know if every ECU has one, but will assume for the sake of argument that they have something like this. This table allows for the fine adjustment of each cylinder to get them working at the same levels. To factor this and get the table adjusted correctly, you need to take the temperature of each cylinder at the exhaust manifold. To perform the operation, you take the temperature of each cylinder (as you stated you did in your question), then make adjustments in the table to compensate. You need to choose one cylinder to work from as your base. In most instances you'd take one of the interior cylinders (in your case either cyl-2 or cyl-3). Once you have established your base, make adjustments to your table to add fuel if it's too hot or subtract fuel if it's too cool. This process could take several iterations to get right. There is a case where certain cylinders may be starved for fuel. In this case, those cylinders would be far cooler than the others due to lack of combustion. In that case you may consider fattening up those cylinders first to alleviate the issue. The theory with adjusting the cylinders to match is if each of the cylinders are working at the same output level (heat output in this case), they are each producing about the same amount of power and therefore are working in concert with each other. This produces better engine harmonics and will help with longevity. It can also help with gas mileage. For the LT1 engine there are tables for ",

      "answer": "Short answer it's not a DIY project. There are many things that need to be checked, specialized equipment, and a mistake can cost you a lot of money. It's against the law to work on AC without a licence in some areas, so check local laws and regulations. There are many reasons the AC is not cooling and a little low on refrigerant is one of them. Topping off the system with a DIY can might work. The cars on the road to day are less forgiving to over/under charge of refrigerant. Being off by as little as 3 - 4 oz is enough to have a major performance hit, or no cooling at all. Too much refrigerant will damage the compressor as well, this can be a slow death so you may not even realize your recharge caused the compressor failure. Refrigerant Oil - Even with the correct equipment it can be difficult to get the oil amount correct. Too little you burn up the compressor, too much can affect the performance or damage the compressor. Using the wrong oil can also damage the compressor. If it's a hybrid with electric AC really don't mess with it,the cost of those compressors run in the thousands and are easy damaged with the incorrect oil. AC systems don't use up refrigerant and if it's low there is a leak. When refrigerant leaks out it takes oil with it, so if you keep topping it off without added oil you'll damage the compressor. Some of the cans have oil in them but that might give you an overcharge of oil leading to compressor failure. As for this guy, I'd stick to more reputable sources for automotive repair. It is recommended that you should recharge your air conditioning system every 2 years with gas and lubricant, in order to keep it running efficiently. This is not included as part of a routine car service and so it can often be overlooked. If your car is more than 2 years old it is more than likely due a re-gas. It's a good idea to service your AC system on a regular basis but recharging it every two years is excessive and a waste of money.",

      "answer": "One of the most influential reason as to why the V4 didnt take off is the ROI(return on investment) . The reason as to why we have the V configuration is to save space , High performance cars have V configuration since they have upwards of 6 to 8 cylinders and putting them in a straight configuration will eat up a lot of space thus the V. In the V4 that advantage is not there since the size difference is very minute. The V4 configuration is more expensive to produce you need 2 cylinder blocks,so on and so forth. Inline cylinders are much much much more refined than V engines and since most 4 cylinder cars are family everyday cars refinements sits on top of requirement. V4 engines are harder to maintain since they have complex builds and harder to reach for components. In summary, there is no need of a much complex V4 engine when an inline 4 can do the job much better at lower cost and higher refinement. That said , Hondas have used the V4s on their VFR range to great success. Edit: Lancia used V4s on the Fulvia on which the stratos is based, to great success in rallying.",

I assumed that sometimes, when people would talk about \"heads\" that this was just an abbreviation of another term \"head gaskets\". Apparently, this is not the case! What exactly are heads? Clarification: Car heads, not human ones...",
      "answer": "tl dr: Cylinder heads (commonly just called \"heads\") are the big piece of metal which caps and seals the end of the cylinder bore. Types of Cylinder Heads: There are three basic types of cylinder heads: Flathead Cylinder Head - These cylinder heads were used on older engines such as the flat-head Ford engines (like seen below). The oval protrusion at the top of the cylinder head is for coolant flow. Coolant would flow up from the block and through passages in the head (between bolt holes) and out through this oval port at the top. Overhead Valve Head (OHV) - This type of cylinder head has been used extensively from the 1950s and are still used today. These heads have the valves located within them instead of in the block like the flathead. The valves are actuated indirectly from the cam through a valve train, which usually consists of lifters (tappets), push rods, and rocker arms. An OHV head usually looks something like these Chevrolet heads below. In the picture, the flat surface of the head (right side of the image) is the portion which faces the engine block. The left side is where you see the valve tips, valve springs, retainers, and keepers. On top of these is where you would see the rocker arms if they were installed. Overhead Cam Head (OHC) - This third type of head usually has the camshaft co-located with the cam. It is called \"over head\", because the cam actually resides over the top of the head. The OHC can have a single (SOHC) or dual (DOHC) configuration. (You can learn more about the differences between a SOHC and DOHC in this SE post). Here are some images showing OHC heads: In this image, it is a little hard to see, but there is one camshaft (you can see the single gear to the left of the head) which extends the length of the head. This single cam shaft actuates both the intake and exhaust valves which are in the head. In this image of a DOHC, you can see the two cam shafts (find two gears to the right of the head in the image). with DOHC, the valves",

Would you get better gas mileage? Would it wear out the engine or transmission faster? For example, going 20 mph in 5th gear down a quiet city street that you know has no stop signs for half a mile or more.",
      "answer": "To answer your question, no it isn't bad for your car to keep it in as high a gear as you can while still maintaining speed. As long as you are above idle in RPM and your engine isn't lugging, you aren't doing any damage. See this link for more information about lugging. You mentioned that you might do this to be quieter and for fuel efficiency. Your car will certainly be quieter, so this is one advantage. As for fuel efficiency, there is such a thing as being in too high a gear in certain situations. Because of the vacuum created when the throttle is closed, and it will be close to closed at such a low RPM, you could potentially be making your engine work more to maintain speed than you would be if you were in a lower gear. This would mean you wouldn't be driving at optimum fuel efficiency. Of course, this depends on your car and many other factors, so there's no way to be sure being in 5th gear is worse for your fuel economy than being in 4th gear at such a low speed. If I had to guess, you will still be getting better fuel economy in 5th gear at 1,000 RPM. When in doubt, to maximize fuel efficiency, use as high a gear as you can manage for the power required.",

      "answer": "The supplied gas values suggest a rich run condition and possibly a non-functional catalyst. Using a mixture calculator for the supplied gas values shows that the mixture is 6.4% rich. CO elevated is the key indicator as it is not present in lean combustion in significant amounts. NOx is produced in significant amounts in lean combustion and requires high gas temperatures usually on seen under loaded conditions. Little is produced at rich mixtures. CO2 is maximized at stoiciometric mixture. So low CO2 can mean rich or lean. FWIW in my vehicle emission testing region (Seattle WA) this engine would pass a tailpipe emission test. Refer to the graph below for with help with gas value interpretation. The left side of the chart is rich and the right is lean. Of the list of possible failures the MAF is a possible cause of a rich condition. Fouled plugs would result in much higher HC due to misfire. Low compression would likely be corrected for by a properly functioning fuel control system including an accurate MAF reading. Oil in the combustion chamber does not greatly affect combustion gas values until it gets to excessive amounts. Failures of the PCV system do usually present as lean run problems.",

      "question": "Should I avoid full throttle when driving with a cold engine?",
      "context": "Apparently I should avoid full throttle until my engine temperature is warmed up fully (to 90 degrees on the gauge) Normally I just get in and drive normally after about 10 seconds, and then after about 2-3 mins I join a fast road with a hill, and drive along with my foot flat to the floor. It normally warms up to about 85-90 degrees in about 10-15 minutes. Someone recently told me this is bad, as it \"damages my engine\"... Is this true? How do I damage my engine by applying full throttle when the engine is not up to temperature? Does also revving over 3500RPM before the engine is fully warmed up damage it? Car: 2003 Opel Agila - 1.2 (Z12XE engine). No turbo or anything. The redline is at 6500 Edit: I don't drive at the redline. I drive in the middle of the rev range normally, but 5k as a max",
      "answer": "Yes this is bad for your engine for a multitude of reasons. In fact, it's not good to run your engine at full throttle for extended periods of time unless the engine is designed to take it, whether it's cold or warmed up. Believe me when I say your little 1.2l Agila engine is not designed to take that kind of stress. I'll start by suggesting that engines, while having a red line are not meant to live at the red line. In other words, the red line is a point not to go past, but also not a place to keep your engine running at. Very few engines are designed that way (NASCAR and F1 engines are exceptions, that's for sure ... but they are completely warmed up before they are run at the engine speeds they are required to run at). Another thing to think about is metal can stand only so much stress before it will fail. The stress on metal is accumulative. I've posted this graph before, but I'll post it again because it bears repeating: This graph is pulled from a book written by Carroll Smith called Engineer to Win. The graph shows that metal has a fatigue limit, or a point at which repeated cycles will have little to no effect on a metal part (meaning a part will last a long, long time if the stress put upon it is below this level). Above this level, the stress put upon the part detracts from its longevity ... the higher the stress, the sooner the part failure. Like I said, this effect is accumulative ... it adds up over time. About this, Carroll Smith said: Simplistically put, under repeated (cyclic as opposed to continuous) stress the capacity of a metal to withstand stress gradually diminishes and, in most cases, cannot be restored. Metals which are subjected to fluctuating loads can and do break after a finite number of load cycles (of, more accurately, stress cycles) in which the loads applied and the resultant stresses imposed are always below the ultimate strength of the metal. This type of failure is termed \"fatigue failure.\" Basically what I was saying, only he say",

      "context": "Brake Specific Fuel Consumption or BSFC Measuring various attributes of an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) and how it performs certainly gives a greater understanding of how a particular ICE performs at various RPM's as well as give the ability to understand economy. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption is one of those measurements. I am looking for answer that illustrates the math behind BSFC and assists a novice in understanding why BSFC matters to them. What are the various metrics and attributes used to come up with a BSFC number? Why does BSFC matter? How can BSFC be changed on an ICE related to intake, ignition timing, exhaust and cam timing?",
      "answer": "Going to take a stab at this... I am not an expert, just what I've put together in my head. A lot of this gets into more general engine tuning/building. BSFC is basically how much power you output for a given amount of fuel. For a given engine, this is dependent on load and RPM. Your lowest BSFC is around your maximum torque at part-throttle. It all has to do with how efficiently your fuel is being burned and turned into rotating force. Most of how efficiently your fuel burns comes from how well atomized the fuel is. This depends on air velocity and temperature of your air/fuel mixture. Gasoline vaporizes at 196*F, so anything above that should be good. Air velocity is said to be best around the speed of sound. I am not 100% sure on how this is exactly calculated, but I would image it would require a dynamometer to measure power output and some way of measuring fuel consumption, possible calculated through fuel pressure, flow rate, and pulse width. BSFC shows how efficiently the fuel is being burned. This is important for engine efficiency and getting good power and gas mileage out of your engine. When manufacturers determine the gearing of the transmission, they want the vehicle to be at peak efficiency around 60mph (since most highways have a speed limit of 55 or 65). This means the final drive (through the transmission top gear, differential, and tire size) will be set so the RPM is around the lowest BSFC while on the highway. Your torque converter will likely be set at a similar RPM, but this is partially because of it being near max torque. RPM matters for 2 reason - air velocity and heat absorption. At lower RPM, the air velocity is not moving fast enough to properly atomize the fuel. At higher RPM, the fuel is not soaking up much heat before being ignited, and does not burn as efficiently. Your sweet spot is in the middle somewhere. This is dependent upon a lot of things I will get into later. Load is similar. When the throttle is closed, the air velocity is ",

      "question": "Why don&#39;t all diesel engines have throttle plates?",
      "context": "I learned recently that many older and some newer diesels don't have throttle plates to control airflow. I was also quite shocked to learn about a condition called diesel engine runaway. Apparently a diesel engine can run out of control from oil pooling in the manifold. It seems that not having throttle plates on older diesel engines has it's risks. Why have newer diesel engines begun to adopt a throttle? What are the ultimate benefits of incorporating a throttle plate into the intake system? I can see benefits regarding preventing diesel runaway conditions. Risk for diesel runaway can be mitigated with intake design to prevent the oil pooling condition in the intake manifold, so why integrate a throttle plate? Would a throttle plate assist in greater level of efficiency for fuel consumption?",
      "answer": "tl dr: By adding a throttle plate, it creates the vacuum needed to draw in gasses from an EGR valve. Since diesel engines are designed to run lean, they don't need throttle plates to run. They utilize the amount of diesel fuel needed to keep the engine running and to provide the work needed to do the job required of them. One of the inherent issues with running lean is with a lean burn, you also run hotter. If the burn is hotter than ~1700 degF, you start to form Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), which is the key ingredient in acid rain and will tear up people's lungs (therefor is nasty stuff). One of the ways to deter the formation of NOx during the combustion cycle is to introduce an Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) process. The spent exhaust gasses provide a means by which to control the burn process thus reducing the heat in during the combustion process. This has been used for many years in gasoline engines. Unfortunately with diesel engines, since there isn't a high level of vacuum in the intake, it won't readily draw the EGR gasses into itself and therefore is self defeating. By adding a throttle plate, it creates the vacuum needed to do the draw.",

      "context": "What is a 6 pack in the hotrodding world? Does it improve performance of my engine?",
      "answer": "A six pack usually refers to the Chrysler (Mopar) carburetor setup which is three-two barrel carbs on an intake. You'll most often hear of it as a 440 Six Pack, the 440 referring to the Big Block Mopar engine displacing 440 cubic inches. Here is an image of such a setup: The interesting thing about these is they are setup sequentially, where the main 2-barrel carb will be used at first, then when the throttle is down enough, you'll get the other two carbs to open allowing for a large rush of air/fuel mixture. This setup up can improve performance of the engine, with one caveat: only if the engine can utilize the increase in air flow. You can put as large of a carburetor on your engine as you want, but if the engine cannot utilize the increase, it will become a dog and will not perform. Other items such as increased exhaust flow (ie: headers), head port work, and large cylinder displacement will be need to fully utilize such a setup. There is another common setup called a Tri-Duce. This was General Motors' version of this setup, but worked much the same way. You could find the Tri-Duce mainly on Corvettes and Pontiacs",

It's going to be a lengthy read so I appreciate your time. There is a strange clunky sound coming either from the engine or gearbox whenever I'm decelerating with the clutch engaged (engine breaking) or when I'm stationary with the clutch engaged. When stationary, the sound doesn't always occur, however, if I repeatedly tap the accelerator pedal, it starts to make a rattling noise. This rattling noise only occurs if the clutch is engaged. Also, when engine breaking, if I disengage the clutch, the noise stops. Also, when pulling away in first gear from a stop, engaging the clutch also produces this noise. After the clutch fully engages, the sound seems to stop. When accelerating, the sound either doesn't occur or is overpowered by the sound of the engine. I was never able to hear it when accelerating.

The expressed purpose is to avoid a spark near the battery, which may potentially be producing hydrogen gas. Some have argued that you can connect to anywhere on the frame. Others have expressed problems with this (probably due to thin grounding wires) and recommend attaching to the engine block. As an electrical engineer, I am taught to never rely upon a body ground to transmit current. There's plenty of issues with doing this, including the fact that mechanical connections and grounding wires are rarely designed for the high amperage. But this seems to be a special case.

This problem is common especially if your stereos speakers are amplified, and can be fixed my making sure that your stereo unit and/or amplifier have a good ground connection. This can be done by either finding a more direct ground connection to the cars frame, sanding the area around your ground connection to remove any rust or paint that could be adding grounding resistance, or even running a ground wire from your stereo or amp directly to your battery. In fact, it is most likely that you are constantly experiencing the whining sound. With the engine idling if you put your ear up to the speaker you will probably hear the sound, it just doesn't become noticeable until higher revs. Note: Making sure any wires you add (+ or -) are properly insulated always helps too!

      "context": "The car has a single reversing light in the bumper. The bulb doesn't light at all (tested, also tried spares). Measuring the voltage at the socket I get around 9V with no bulb in the circuit (with just the ignition on; 10V with the engine running). The meter is high-impedance. All the other bulbs are fine. With no other path to ground in the circuit that I know of (no reversing sensors powered off it) I'm puzzled as to what can cause this voltage drop. The voltage at the appropriate fuse is the normal 12-13V, higher with the engine running. So I've reached the conclusion that there must be a partial short in the switch, but this seems unlikely. This is a 2002 Focus (UK spec) the 2 litre version with the MTX75 transmission. This means the switch plugs in to the top of the transmission housing, and is a little fiddly to get at but shouldn't be too bad once the air filter housing is out. The ground at the socket is good, measured to the earthing stud inside the rear wing (where the wiring",
      "answer": "As you wrote, it is unlikely that the supply line of the bulb has a short, but not impossible. Beneath that, it's possible that the return line has a bad connection to the chassis. If an other device uses the same line, the flowing current rises the voltage on that line, and you measure a lower voltage between supply and return line. A bad contact in the supply line is not possible, as the high-impedance meter should show the full 12V then. Here is what you can do, with the bulb removed: Check for bad connection in return line Find a good conducting point at the chassis (not at a door!) This could be a screw or similar. Now, measure the voltage between this point and the terminals of the bulb. If one has 12V and the other 3V (-> 9V between terminals), you have a bad connection. Check for short in supply line If the bulb has its own fuse, i.e. the fuse supplies no other devices, pull the fuse and measure the current across the terminals (meter set to highest DCA range). If there's a short, you should observe a current of a few amps, otherwise not. Further checks of supply line Pull the connector of the switch. Is there still a high current through the fuse? Then, the problem is before the switch. Plug in the fuse again, and measure the voltage between chassis and the terminals of the cable of the switch. One should have 12V (from the fuse) and one should have 0V (to the bulb). Measure the resistance between that terminal and the chassis. If it is just a few ohms, you have a short in the line to the bulb. If it is above say... 1kOhm, the line is OK. The main question with measuring the supply line is what other devices are connected to it. The ECU may be connected to this line to recognize the reverse gear, and most 3rd party reverse cameras are also clamped to this line and consume current / generate low resistance. This makes the diagnosis a little difficult.",

      "answer": "With the description you give, I'd say you connected them backwards with about a 99%+ assurance. Large amounts of sparks followed by heat are both VERY BAD SIGNS (as you soon figured out) and almost always mean you have the jumpers on backwards. Never trust what the covers on the battery says. Check what the battery says to be sure. If there is no way to see what is on the battery (the terminals cover them), follow the cables back to their source. The negative will go to a ground and the positive will go to the starter and to the alternator. If those are correct, ensure that the jumper cables are correctly aligned. Some sets I've seen will have black shielding on both with a thin yellow (or some other color) stripe up them. It would be very easy to mix these up. If you still think it was right, you could ultimately check each side of the jumper cables for continuity to ensure you are matching them up.",

      "question": "Why would my electrical systems cut out when I brake?",
      "context": "So I told this little story to the dealership service department, and they were baffled. Never heard of anything like it in ten years, said they'd have to examine it very closely. Here's what happened two months ago: I drive a Subaru Legacy 97. I turned the car on and was about to shift out of Park to drive away, so I stepped on the brake and as I did so, my headlights dimmed, my radio volume shrank and all the interior displays hiccuped. I took my hand off the shift, all thoughts of driving forgotten, and started playing with the brake. It did the same thing repeatedly. After a few tries, I stomped on the brake and everything blinked off entirely for a second, and the engine nearly shut down. The electricity came back in less than half a second -- it wasn't a prolonged outage -- just a brief interruption -- so the engine caught itself and stayed running. But for just a moment, the whole car had shut off. This only happened once to that extent once, and I have been unable to reproduce ",
      "answer": "Sure enough, you've got a damaged wire that is shorting out the entire electrical system. So think about what happens when you press on the brake pedal, it sends power to your brake lights at the back of the car, so if one of those wires were shorting, you would only notice it when you tap the brakes. The weird thing is, this doesn't happen very often, because that's what fuses are for. Your brake light fuse should blow when your brake lights short out, preventing the problem from spreading to the rest of your car and killing your engine. So some how the problem seems to be bypassing a fuse. You should check your fuses.",

      "question": "Are there downsides to making an accessory socket always live, if accessories are removed when not in use?",
      "context": "In some cars, the power line from the battery to the accessory outlet (aka cigarette lighter socket) is always live. In others, it's off until ignition. It seems pretty much random which cars are wired which way, and some cars are wired differently between models in the same series. Assuming I'm not going to do anything stupid like leave a power-draining accessory plugged in over the weekend, are there any side-effects, disadvantages or risks to rewiring an ignition-only socket so that it has a (fused!) direct connection to the battery, bypassing ignition? Why I'm asking, if anyone is interested: I want to connect a trickle-charge solar panel to my car battery in a car (Toyota RAV4) that doesn't have an always-hot accessory socket (I mostly use the car for short journeys at night, sometimes with days/weeks between journeys and usually 3+ weeks between long journeys, which is terrible for draining my battery - this panel is designed for this purpose and doesn't draw any power when there",

Question I have the Hayne's manual for my car, and a good multimeter, but to be honest the wiring diagrams are mostly greek to me. I don't even know where to start in trying to figure out where the short might be, or how to fix the wiring. However, I would like to learn. Any advice, tutorials, or resources would be greatly appreciated.",
      "answer": "My immediate thought there was the flasher relay. Pull this out and either test it outside the car or swap it for a known-good one. If that is not the fault, then as you rightly point out, you need to make sense of the wiring diagram... The key thing here is the wire colours. Most cars have two-colour wiring, with a main colour and a trace colour (i.e. the little stripe down one side). If you can identify that you ought to be able to identify where each wire enters and exits the loom. However, it is usually easier to identify the circuit components and work from them. I don't have access to a Chevy wiring diagram, but I would imagine it to work as follows: battery -> ignition switch -> fuse box -> flasher relay -> signal switch -> bulbs -> ground. (this is slightly different if hazard warning lights are fitted, I don't know if you use them over there? or are they a European thing? ) Obviously you know the battery and ignition are working, so I'd start by removing the fuse and relay and checking as follows: 12v at fuse box 'live' ground at bulb earth. Relay power and ground continuity between fuse output and relay input no short between 4 and battery -ve switch operation (disconnect it if you can) repeat 4 and 5 for relay->switch and switch->lamps. But I'd still suspect the relay first... (p.s. 1993 isn't old, it's not even 20 yet!)",

I bled my brakes and now the pedal goes to the floor all the time with little stopping power. My auto shop teacher says I need a new master cylinder, but it was fine before bleeding the brakes. Also the brake light on the dashboard came on. Any ideas? Thank you.",
      "answer": "You need to completely rebleed your system. You obviously have air in it. If you have a power bleeder which fits the master cylinder, the better. For future reference: DO NOT BLEED THE BRAKING SYSTEM BY REMOVING ALL THE BRAKE FLUID FIRST!!! I apologize for yelling at you, but this is absolutely the wrong way to go about bleeding the system. The idea is to replace the old fluid as you are putting new fluid into the system. You run the old fluid out until it runs clear. As you've discovered it will cause you all kinds of issues. It may be very hard to bleed all of the air out of the system, but you need to bleed it sooner rather than later. If you don't have a power bleeder, use a friend to pump the brakes for you. Please do the following to general steps: What you'll need: A brand new (never opened) bottle of brake fluid (per your vehicle specs) ... in your case, you may need two to completely redo the job A wrench (spanner) to open the bleeder valve (usually a 5/16\" boxed end) A clear plastic bottle to drain the fluid into A piece of plastic tubing like you'd find for fish tanks A friend with big burly quad muscles who can hear and follow direction What you do: Open your bottle of NEW brake fluid and pour about an inch worth in the bottom of the clear container Pop the top on the master cylinder; ensure it is full; leave the top off (you need to check it often as you go through the process) Start your process at the brake cylinder/caliper which is farthest away from the master cylinder NOTE: If you need to jack the car up or take the wheel off, ensure you put the vehicle on a jack stand so you do not endanger yourself. At the caliper/cylinder, put the boxed end of your wrench on the bleeder valve. Use the wrench to loosen it slightly without allowing any air to seep in ... all you are looking to do is break the valve free.

      "context": "I had my car brakes replaced about 2 years ago, since then I've driven about 4000 miles (I work downtown and tend to use public transit) after which I disconnected the battery and stopped using my car (for almost a year). Yesterday I took my car out and went to get an inspection sticker. The guy told me that I need new brakes/rotors and an oil change (despite the low mileage on my rotors). The car is a 2004 A4 Audi, I went along with his suggestion but after realizing that he's changing the rotors too (which he didn't mention at first), I'm concerned that he may be doing unnecessary work. The final bill is coming out to be pretty expensive. He says that since the car has been unused for a while, this is expected although most online articles I'm reading are stating that fluid change is enough after car has been unused for several months to a couple years. Unfortunately I don't have a picture in front of me but the condition of my old brakes looks very similar to this: https://i.sstatic",
      "answer": "I would get a second opinion. It's quite possible that your rotors have developed rust in that time. However, if they resemble the rotors in the picture that you provided then they should still be fine. That rust appears to be the same kind that develops inevitably over time with use. There is a certain thickness that all rotors must be at in order to still be considered safe. Rust on rotors usually isn't a problem unless it is causing issues with your braking. Most times, a little rust on rotors will only wear brake pads a little differently. You can actually have surface rust removed from rotors with a special grinding machine (called turning the rotors when I worked at a shop) at certain car repair shops (provided they still satisfy the thickness requirement). Long story short, I wouldn't replace the rotors if they look like the ones in your picture. Get a second opinion from a different mechanic, have your current rotors turned if you wish, and continue on as you would normally from there. You should be fine.",

      "question": "Brake fade and spongy brakes at high speeds",
      "context": "I was driving my girlfriends Ford Fiesta last week and it started to experience brake fade. It always happened after driving the car at higher speeds over 100kmh (60 MPH). The brake pedal became spongy and there was a diminished braking effect. I noticed the left rear wheel heating up, so I guess the left rear brake is not releasing completely. After reducing traveling speeds, driving at around 70kmh (around 40MPH), brakes become responsive again and sponginess went away. This leads me to think that the left rear brake is scraping and at higher speeds causing heat to build up which boils the braking fluid. So I scheduled the car for brake fluid replacement and a brake inspection to determine why the brakes are scraping. The guys at garage saw the rear braking cable was damaged and said that the braking issues came from the brake cable. I am not saying braking cable couldn't cause this problem, but I doubt it, and they haven't opened the drums to see why the shoes don't fully release. I",
      "answer": "Based on what you have posted, changing the brake fluid is not going to solve the problem. It's just going to provide a clean new fluid to boil when your brakes stick. If I read what you said correctly the guys at the garage are telling you that the brake cable (likely the emergency brake cable) on the rear is what's causing the rear brakes to stick. They may be stuck all the time but you only notice the problem at higher speeds because the effect is too small to notice at low speed. In the end, you need to fix the cable, and then replace the fluid. And while the cable is being fixed, have them check inside the drum to see if there is an additional problem that's making the pads stick. By the way, how did you know the drivers side rear wheel was getting hot?",

      "context": "I have often seen motorcycles like the BMW S100RR and the famous Ducati Panigale with Quick Shifter technology which allows seamless gear changes. I want to know how these things work mechanically and are there any advantages or disadvantages of the tech.",
      "answer": "Why the Quick-Shifter? Since these are called quick-shifters we'll dub slow-shifting the traditional way of shifting gear. When you slow-shift you usually close the throttle, disengage the clutch, act on the gear shifting pedal, engage the clutch and reopen the throttle. Now, this is a time-consuming process (a few hundreds of milliseconds) which might be undesirable in a racing environment where every fraction of a second counts. Enters: the quick-shifter. How Does it Work? There are many types of quick-shifters out there and not all use the same methods although they all aim at achieving a common goal: reduce load on the drive-train to safely engage a higher gear without damaging the gearbox. The way this is done is usually by momentarily cutting fuel and/or ignition for a few tens of milliseconds during which the gear is engaged. All of this happens without the need to close the throttle. Just to give you an idea of how fast a quick-shifter can operate, see this video of a quick-shifting ZX10. The quick-shifter is usually a sensor reading the position of the shifter, informing a microcontroller of when up-shifting takes place in order for the controller to cut the fuel/ignition. It looks something like this: Image courtesy of Kawi Forums A quick-shifter circuit typically looks like this: Image courtesy of R6ers In this case you have one cable for each sparkplug which suggests that this unit cuts the ignition when quick-shifting. Is Quick-Shifting Harmful for the Gearbox? The general consensus on the internet seems to be that quick-shifting can be less harmful for the gearbox than slow-shifting since the engine power is guaranteed to be lowered when the fuel/ignition are cut. Whereas an unskilled driver manually operating the clutch is more likely to make the mistake of leaving the throttle open during up-shifting.",

      "question": "Why do hybrids still use mechanical transmission?",
      "context": "One of the comments on this question reminded me of something I've been wondering for a while. Given that engines get the best efficiency at peak torque, why do most hybrid cars still use a mechanical transmission (which requires the engine to change speed with roadspeed, as in a conventional car), rather than electrical, with the engine running at a constant rate as a generator? Is it simply a case of giving people what they are used to? bearing in mind that pure-electric cars obviously have electric transmission... Trains have been using diesel-electric transmission since at least the 1950s, so it's not exactly a new concept...",
      "answer": "It depends on the type of hybrid car you are talking about. In one type of hybrid, there will be a gasoline engine and at least one electric engine capable of driving the wheels. In this case, the gasoline engine must still use a transmission because it cannot be revved too high without causing major damage or shortened life. One possible solution to this transmission issue would be to use a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), which can be more expensive to manufacture but keeps the engine at peak efficiency. The other type of hybrid, where the wheels are driven entirely by electric motors (and has a gasoline generator to charge the battery) does not require a transmission because electric motors have a very wide range of acceptable RPM. Additionally, electric motors have a relatively flat torque curve and the max torque is available instantly. I should note that this type of \"hybrid\" car is generally just called an electric vehicle (EV) since the gasoline motor is used to charge the battery only and does not drive the wheels. I was going to comment this, but don't have the reputation: The diesel-electric transmission you referred to is more closely related to today's EVs in that a diesel engine charges batteries, which then in turn power electric motors at the wheels. Transmissions in trains are impractical for several reasons (such as need to power up to four axles and the number of gears that would be required to keep it at peak efficiency) and this eliminates the need for a true transmission.",

      "question": "How does Audi Crown Gear Center Differential work?",
      "context": "I'm trying to understand how the engagement of the clutches is varied. I see the power is transmitted through the center input shaft and is transmitted through the four pinion gears, but I don't understand how the engagement of the clutch(s) is controlled based on which axle has more/less traction. Its it a centrifugal mechanism that is not clearly illustrated, or maybe even the shape(conical?) of the pinion gears them selfs? One point I have heard is the front and rear Crown gears are of a different diameters and the diameter determines the torque split(Some what illustrated, larger diameter being the rear axle which statically gets 60% assuming even traction). One question I would like to answer from all this is, what would happen if traveling at a non-insignificant speed (45 Mph +), and the rear axle was stopped momentarily (imagine hitting the Emergency brake), what results could you expect?",
      "answer": "This set up is a quazai differential/planetary gear set. This can make it difficult to see how it functions. Power comes in from the transmission and into the pinon gear carrier and pinon gears. The pinon gears then transfer power to the front and rear crown gears. While the speed of the front and rear axles is the same the pinons do not rotate on their axis. This guarantees that the differential housing is also rotating at the same speed. When the front axle, for example, starts to spin faster because it lost traction the front crown will spin faster. Because the speed of the two crowns is not the same the pinon gears start to spin on their axis. The spinning causes the pinon carrier to spin faster which also causes the differential housing to spin faster. Because the differential housing has a set of clutches attaching it to the crown it will drag the slower crown along trying to speed it up. This sends power from the wheels that slip to the wheels that grip. If you hit the parking break while driving at high speed and lets say lock up the wheels the front wheels will just roll. Because you shouldn't be hitting the gas pedal in the process the speed difference will get sent into the transmission which will be free wheeling.",

Fast forward to this morning, I tried to start the car, but it had difficulty cranking, it was barely able to spin the pulley and was making a clicking noise. I measured and it was 10.5V. I went to charge it with a 10 amp 12 v charger for like 8 hrs.

Is my battery busted? Should I try charging it for a longer time?",
      "answer": "Yes, this is a bad battery. One of the cells has most likely shorted. Each cell is a little above 2vdc. A fully charged battery will usually be ~13vdc. If you lose one cell, it will drop it down ~2vdc, which puts it right down in the arena of 10.5vdc. A direct short inside of a cell will allow electrons to pass through the short instead of raising the voltage, which is the reason you're still reading the 10.5vdc.

I am now trying to get it up and running however I am unable to charge either battery. The main battery is around 14 months old and the leisure is around 3 years old. I have a main charger which I have connected, however the charge gauge does not move when I connect the positive and negative leads to the batteries. When I touch the positive and negative leads together, they spark and the charge gauge moves. I therefore believe that the charger is working OK. Could there be something wrong with both batteries that is not allowing the current to flow around the battery from positive to negative and therefore stopping them from being charged? Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",
      "answer": "I assume the battery is completely dead? Multimeter not showing anything? There are a couple of chargers that will try and revive a battery (Accumate/Optimate for example) that's pretty much completely dead, but your average parts store charger needs some charge left in the battery before it'll work. Even if you get the batteries recharged, you've already severely shortened their lifespan unless they're deep discharge batteries. In fact you might already have ended up with two large paperweights but I'd still try to recharge them and see what happens. If you're storing batteries for longer than a couple of months I would suggest that you'll recharge them from time to time or hook them up to good trickle/float charger (not the 4.99 special). These batteries really don't like standing around discharged.",

      "question": "Is there any advantage to keeping the battery &quot;topped up&quot;?",
      "context": "I got an engine/cabin heater installed into my car right before winter, which was great for driving comfort this winter. One of its \"side-effect\" features is that it charges and keeps your battery at 14.1 volts while it's connected. Does this have any effect on the battery's lifespan or is it just going to hide issues with a failing battery? Does it really influence anything at all?",
      "answer": "As long as it is not overcharging your battery, it will increase the useful life of the battery. The reason behind this is, as a battery sits, it loses power. Some of the electrolysis which goes on to make a battery work, also breaks down the battery. During this period, the battery goes through a sulfating period, where sulfur crystals grow on the lead plates. This only happens during discharge. The better charge which is on the battery, the less sulfation occurs. As your charger is keeping the battery topped off, it is also slowing the sulfation condition, which prolongs the life. Please realize a battery is not going to last forever, but a well maintained battery is going to last much longer than a battery which just sits. Maintaining the battery in this sense helps keep the battery in good shape, which is never a bad thing.",

      "context": "Small batteries for Motorcycles and Lawn Tractors are typically sold with the electrolyte in a separate bottle and must be added to the battery at home before installing it. I've never seen a \"dry\" car battery - they always seem to be full of electrolyte and ready to go at the auto parts store. What's the main reason for this? Is there a fundamental difference between a small battery and a large car battery, or is it \"just the way it's done\"? It seems like if nothing else, separate electrolyte would give the battery a longer shelf life, and make transportation easier. Electrolyte bottle playfully peeking out from behind battery...",
      "answer": "To answer the title question, no. I've worked in several automotive retail outlets and have never seen an automotive battery not precharged. They may exist, but it would be an odd sight to see. Automotive batteries are very frequently purchased and installed in the same transaction. The batteries in which you need to put in the electrolyte, you also need to charge them for several hours. This would prove very impractical and annoying to the customer. One thing to note is due to the rate at which these smaller batteries are sold. Motorcycle and lawn equipment batteries are often sold less frequently, and may end up sitting on a shelf for a very long time. Once the battery is given its first charge, its lifetime begins. If it ends up sitting for too long, the customer will have a battery that may not last as long as if they had bought it and charged it themselves. I may also point out that the most common lawn and garden batteries I've seen are filled and pre-charged, though the warranty is usually only a 3 months (just the summer season), and many customers end up buying a new battery every year. The durability does not seem to be very high compared to their larger cousins. And just a side-note, some customers will look through the rack of compatible batteries and pick out the newest manufactured battery (it's usually stamped or stickered onto the case) in order to get the longest lifetime out of their purchase. I've seen similar actions done with tires.",

      "question": "Accidentally poured engine oil into the coolant reservoir",
      "context": "My 1990 Mazda 626 leaks oil like a sieve, so I regularly top up the oil. In a moment of stupidity, I opened my radiator cap instead of my oil cap while topping up my engine oil, and poured about 50-100 mls of engine oil into my radiator. What implications is this likely to have on the car?",
      "answer": "Normally, I would ask first in a comment but that seems to be a privilege not available to new users, so here goes: Are you sure it was the radiator cap and not the overflow bottle? The radiator is usually full and getting 100ml in would be a struggle, not to mention that the green coolant would be staring you in the face. If you radiator wasn't full then you either have an empty overflow bottle, or your system wasn't burped properly the last time the coolant was changed, or you have a leaking head gasket introducing combustion gasses into your coolant system. If it was the overflow bottle, there's a good chance that you car hasn't drawn the oil in from the overflow bottle yet. I say this because the pickup for the overflow bottle is near the bottom of the tank, engine oil floats on water and is insoluble in water. My advice then is to remove the overflow bottle, clean it with a degreaser and refill with coolant. If you did actually get it in the radiator, let me know and I'll edit this answer. As far as implications of oil in the radiator go: Oil will, in theory, attack the hoses and water pump seals. This would probably be a long term degradation rather than a sudden failure, and given the oil problem I doubt your engine will survive long enough to see the long term effects. My father's vehicle has been running with a slight oil-to-coolant leak for about two years, without any (visible) ill effects. The vast majority of the oil (after you've removed the head of oil floating in the radiator filler) will collect under the radiator cap as a creamy goo, which you can periodically remove. Replacing the coolant wont do much to remove the oil that has coated the inner surfaces of your cooling system. If you have oil in the radiator and haven't run the car yet, siphon out the oil before it touches any more surfaces in the cooling system.",

      "context": "Let's say that I just replaced my engine oil but decided I want to lift the valve covers to do some gasket replacement. I know it may sound cheap but I'd rather not throw away $25 worth of almost new oil. Would it be safe to catch the old oil in a receptacle and set it aside and put it back into the engine once I am done with my repair?",
      "answer": "As @dodgethesteamroller stated, there is nothing wrong with reusing the engine oil. There are two caveats and one concern I'd like to mention with this. First, use a clean container to store the oil in while you are doing your engine work. Your normal engine drain pan will probably not give you the cleanliness you are looking for. You DO NOT want to have the dirt and crud which collects in the pan to be put into your engine. Second, it's probably a good idea to change out the oil filter when you are doing this. It doesn't hurt anything and should only cost you a few dollars to replace. Concern: Before you decide you are going to reuse your nearly new engine oil, you need to realize the reasons for doing the work on the engine in the first place. If you are replacing worn bearings, you don't want to reuse your engine oil no matter how new it is, because it will more than likely have metal fragments from the old bearings in it ... no sense in putting metal particles back into your engine and having all those wear items thrown into the mix. It just does not make sense. I don't blame you for wanting to save a buck and/or the environment, but don't ruin your new engine work in the process by not utilizing some common sense.",

      "context": "I want to know if the methods a vehicle decides when to turn on the oil change light have to do with the qualities of the motor oil used in the last oil change. I have heard that the vehicle's computer calculates when the oil change light turns on due to number of engine startups, average speed of trip, time before thermostat opens. Now all of these (are there more?) can not infer the quality of oil engine with a possible except to the time it takes for the thermostat opening which may be a slight way to indirectly infer the type of oil last used. I ask this question because supposedly synthetic motor oil lasts longer than conventional and if that is true I might wait longer after the oil change light turns based on my knowledge of how many hard/highway miles I have put on my vehicle.",
      "answer": "I found a reference pdf for GM's Oil Life Monitor System. How does the system work? The GM Oil Life Monitor System is not a mileage counter. It is actually a computer based software algorithm that determines when to change oil based on engine operating conditions. There is no actual oil condition sensor. Rather, the computer continuously monitors engine-operating conditions to determine when to change oil. Over the years, millions of test miles have been accumulated to calibrate the system for a variety of vehicles. The system was first introduced in 1988 and is now on more than 10 million GM vehicles. also Do I have to use special oil? The GM Oil Life Monitor System is calibrated for use with standard “Starburst” mineral- based automotive engine oil. Synthetic oils are not required except for the Corvette. Make sure to read the owner’s manual and select the viscosity and oil grade that is correct for your engine. Any oil selected for use should carry the ILSAC “Starburst”. Thus it appears the Oil Life Monitor System does depend on which type of oil you use for it to give an accurate reading.",

      "answer": "Two words, fuel economy. Using a thinner oil allows manufacturers to eek out a little more fuel economy. Thinner oil flows a little easier and has a little less resistance.

What happens if they drive in the summer? UPDATE For the record, for me, I realize now that I was driving with low antifreeze except for maybe one or two trips (of about 40). I believe a few trips I ran completely out because the temperature shot up 10 to 20 degrees over the span of a mile. I pulled over as soon as I noticed this and could pull off the road or into a gas station and added coolant. I was able to take it in to get fixed. The mechanics ran pressure tests on it and found the coolant leak in the water pump. They replaced it and it's running fine",
      "answer": "Without water and without antifreeze or just without antifreeze? I'll assume that you mean without either, but there is a big difference. This is really simple though. The engine will overheat, quickly, and the seals and gaskets will give out, letting fluids leak in and out of places they should or shouldn't be (like the radiator and water pump, for starters). Eventually, parts of the engine will stop working all together and depending on how long you let this go on for, the engine will need to be taken apart and repaired or it may just need to be melted down for scrap metal, to put it simply.",

      "context": "Hello I realized today after beating my head about my car's overheating problems that I have the wrong coolant in it. About a year ago, my car ran dry. At the bottom of the expansion tank was an orange crust(also the manual recommend DexCool.. ). I ignored the Dexcool warning in my manual as one of those \"you also need to take it to a certified dealer to get the oil changed\" type of warnings. So I filled it up with green coolant. Well, reading up more I realize that I'm wrong. About 6 months ago, I had a wreck and got the radiator replaced(salvaged) and the mechanic(who I'm convinced now is an idiot) filled it up with green coolant along with leaving several leaks. I took it to another mechanic and after fixing the leaks, he also filled it up with green coolant. So I've been running green coolant for about a year now. How exactly should I go about switching to the proper Dexcool coolant? Would it do more harm than good to switch now? Also, my car is having problems in that it overheats",
      "answer": "As long as you don't mix the two coolants together you should not have any problem. I run \"green\" coolant in my GM that came with Dexcool, and have been for more than 5 years. You do want to check the ratio of coolant and water as straight coolant (or too much compared to water) will not cool as well. To answer your question I wouldn't bother switching, if you decide to do so anyway simply flush the system and refill with the coolant of your choice. To address your overheating concern, if it only overheats sitting still you need to check the fan operation and the shroud around the fan and radiator. Another possibility is the water pump, I have seen the fins wear off and the water pump stop circulating coolant, if yours is starting to do this it may not be circulating enough water at the lower RPM's at idle.",

Two, if this coolant bottle was placed on its side such as in the image below for example would coolant still circulate with the return pipe submerged under water? In other words is there any reason why the coolant return is placed at the top of the bottle. Don't panic I’m not getting any wild ideas of placing my expansion bottle on its side it is for a different project I am building to cool a series of GPU's (not related to cars) however the cooling system will be the same to that of a car as the pump will be a centrifugal impeller and the system will be pressurised. Interested in all input to this subject thank you all for your time. Please excuse the poor drawing in paint but i don't have time to draw something extravigant in CAD. one last thing the cap will be above coolant level to release excess pressure.",
      "answer": "This particular bottle is knows as a degas bottle. The reason it has a strange shape is two fold. First, the bottle needs to fit somewhere and the shape helps that. Second and more important is that these degas bottles hold pressure. The shape reinforces the bottle so that it does not explode. In cooling systems with degas bottles the coolant does not circulate through the bottle. The engine feed line connects to the lowest part of the engine and the \"return\" line connects to the highest point in the engine. This helps to fill the engine with coolant. As coolant is added to the bottle it flows to the lowest point in the engine. The air then escapes out the highest point in the engine. Your plan will work with only one stipulation. These degas tanks tend to have separators inside. If the feed and return sides have a separator that is higher than the cap the system may overflow. A practical test may be in order. Here is another crappy picture as an example.",

The process requires disconnecting the exhaust pipes going into the engine to get access to the transmission. When the shop put it back, the driver's side pipe connection \"disintegrated\" as the guy described it. It's in a cold state with lots of rock salt on the roads so there's a lot of rust. The pipe itself is fine, and the bolted \"bracket\" part that connects to the engine seems fine. It appears to be just the connection point, maybe a weld, almost like caulking (but not really caulking of course), was holding the pipe and engine together. The pipe is able to move upwards into the connection fine. Questions: Can I just put the pipe back in and do something to seal them together again? Or do I need to replace that section of the exhaust pipe or the entire exhaust pipe? Should the transmission shop pay for the muffler repair since they broke it? Or not, since the parts were rusted before they started work",
      "answer": "Can I just put the pipe back in and do something to seal them together again? Or do I need to replace that section of the exhaust pipe or the entire exhaust pipe? You can attempt welding. It's not easy materials to weld, with thin walls and a lot of corrosion, and possibly high enough temperatures to burn some carbon out of the steel - but the downside is small, as the worst that happens is that you destroy it, and have to buy new. Exhaust parts are usually quite cheap. Should the transmission shop pay for the muffler repair since they broke it? Or not, since the parts were rusted before they started work? On a 24 year old car? Nah. It's in the category shit happens. Exhaust systems are exposed to corrosion, and failures is rather common. I have lower-to-intermediate mechanic skills. Oil changes, filters, brakes, rotors, spark plugs, fuel filter -type of experience. Can I do this repair in my garage or should I take it to a muffler shop? It's a fairly easy repair - remove the old and install the new parts. Bolts may be rusted, so you will need some hand tools, patience and penetrating oil. But it's fairly low skill, and the consequences of fuckups tends to be small. So I'd say go ahead.",

      "question": "Motorcycle exhaust rattling / clunking / popping / burbling on deceleration",
      "context": "Lately I noticed a change in the sound my exhaust is making when decelerating from ~4000+ revs while in gear with the clutch not squeezed (that would be engine breaking probably). I'm unsure how to describe the sound with a word, but it fits with what these guys are reporting on the model forum - popping maybe would be a good word (like popcorn in the microwave, but a bit more metalic). Also according to the explanations on the forum it is behaving as expected (because of mechanical reasons I don't fully understand, but I would trust them). Now comes the question, why did it start making this sound just lately? I have this bike since autumn and I didn't notice it until this week. Could it be related to weather? The temperatures only recently started going over 20° C (28° even, today). Asking for: Triumph Tiger 800, from 2011, with stock exhaust (fuel injected). Update: I took out the spark plugs and the air filter. Cleaned them a bit with a wire brush for the former and compressed air ",
      "answer": "Popping I too have a Tiger 800xc (2013) and have noticed it popping when downshifting and revs are too high for that gear. I did notice a significant difference in this behavior after 12,000 mile service, and using 91 RON fuel (not all brands and outlets are same... for me ARCO has worked best). At this point, I consider some of it as normal behavior. From your update, considering the mechanics are OK, then a map update might help as it will also address fuel mix being too lean or too rich. That can be done using TuneECU. Tutorial and resources to work with TuneECU can be found at http://www.triumphrat.net/ecm-and-fi-tuning-help-tips-and-tricks/218346-tuneecu-for-dummies-installation-guide-and-questions-pertaining-to-installation.html#post2353942 . It is too long to be copied here, and I strongly recommend reading the whole post before beginning work with TuneECU. TuneECU will also tell you the reason for Check Engine light being lit, however you will not be able to clear it. Check Engine Light From my experience, check engine light signifies that an error has been detected by the system and is stored in the ECU. Those errors can be manually cleared using software like DealerTool or similar. I suggest you get that kit (proprietary cable and accompanying software for Windows) if you want to stick with European brands and see yourself working with engine lights and flushing ABS brakes. It will also help you align your throttle bodies if they are not properly aligned. The check engine light will go away on itself after about 500 km or miles if the problematic condition is no longer there. To check if you are dealing with one off issue, address/understand the error stored in the ECU and clear them to fix the Check Engine light. Diagnosis and resolution can be found in forums and Triumph's service manual - https://github.com/tonymorris/800xc/blob/master/manuals.md. If the same error reappears after being cleared, then you might need more work and service manual should st",

However, with a 4-cylinder Ford Model A engine, I have been told this is not the case because it has such low compression. If there is any validity to straight/short/custom pipes burning valves, what is the cause and why does it happen?",
      "answer": "Human Error I have firm belief that the cause of burned valves with short pipes is due completely to human error, lack of understanding and poor judgement. I believe this myth has been perpetuated by actual 'evidence' of having burned valves but the attribution of the cause is incorrect. Guy with burned valves story He has a hot rod he builds. He uses the engine out of an old Camaro that had glass packs on it. He orders short pipes, a Holly Quadrajet and an HEI. When it's all done he drives it around and it's loud. One day he tears his heads off cuz it's running crappy and discovers burned valves. He looks over at his friend and says, \"Damn short pipes.\" His friend nods his head in affirmation and says, \"Yup.\" The myth begins. Poor attribution and assumption of cause The builder had heard the story, was warned by his friends that his pipes should be longer, ordered them anyway and learned his lesson. Now he is preaching the gospel and telling all his car friends and everyone on the message board about how he put short pipes on his 'ride' and they burned up the valves. \"You should have seen them. They looked like burned brussel sprouts on the end of black sticks.\" His testimony is revered by his crowd because his rod is the baddest one and they go on and wash, rinse, repeat the story. Perpetual motion myth. It even generates it's own energy.

      "question": "Mass Air Flow Expected Values",
      "context": "I have a 2002 Audi A4 Quattro 3.0. I have a Vagcom USB cable and I am trying to diagnose the MAF sensor. I had a friend get some readings from an OBD2 scanner, which indicated that both precat O2 sensors (passenger side and driver side) had negative values. He said that it probably isn't the O2 sensors, since both of them are reading similar readings. He also said it is possibly the MAF sensor or a vacuum leak somewhere. I have taken these readings from the MAF sensor. It appears that the \"grams per second\" is not going above 50, even when the engine is revving at 7000 rpm. Does this indicate that the MAF is faulty? Is there anything else I can do to see if this really is the problem? I have found this PDF: http://www.ross-tech.net/vag-com/advertising/DiagnosingA_MAF_TechTip.pdf Which indicates that this value should peak at about 160 g/s in a 200 horse power car. However, the altitude could be a factor in calculating this. I am located in Denver Colorado, roughly mile above sea level.",
      "answer": "The 50 g/s max flow reading that you are getting is far lower than what merely altitude can explain. The chart above shows that at about 5,200 ft above sea level, the density of air is 83% of what it is at sea level (0.062 lb/cu.ft vs. .075 lb/cu.ft). So to account for the altitude, you should multiply your expected mass flow by 0.83. According to the VAG-COM diagnosis guide, which I have no reason to doubt, a 200bhp naturally-aspirated engine should flow about 160g/s of air at full-throttle peak power when at sea level. Therefore, at 5,200 ft above sea level, it should flow 160 g/s * 0.83 = 133 g/s. You're seeing 50 g/s. You're certianly not metering enough air through the MAF. This could be a MAF failure, or a big leak after the MAF.",

I had the refrigerant refilled two years ago, but I haven't used the car in over a year so I don't know when the AC stopped working. It was working up until the last time I used it, anyway. I was told it would be about $85 to refill the refrigerant, but that it wouldn't do me much good if I had a leak.

      "answer": "Should last forever, as long as the A/C system stays sealed (which it's supposed to be). Problem is that A/C parts are quite readily damaged and leaks are very common. Solution is to find the leaks and fix them. Usually ends up being the condensor, and it's normally recommended to replace the dryer whenever the system is touched. Those 2 alone can cost $500-1000 depending on the car. Used parts are not typically available (and if they are, they're usually not reliable anyways 'cause A/C parts are so easily damaged).

A big two-stroke will have a very short service life, even with constant maintenance. Two-stroke engines burn oil in their fuel and burning oil causes pollution. The charging of the cylinders by its port arrangements mean they are not fuel efficient. Burning more fuel inefficiently again gives more pollution. The Communist East German Trabant was the last vehicle made with a two-stroke engine, you dont have to say anything else really.

I know this is stupid but how does engine size relate to the amount of fuel being burned in one cycle. For example I drive a Ford Ka with a: 1.3i Endura-E engine OHV 1.3 L I4.

      "answer": "With regular driving the Air/Fuel ratio is kept constant at 14.7:1. So if a larger engine needs more air (more swept volume) per cycle then yes it will require more fuel. So the question boils down to which engine has more friction per cycle, and which car has more weight to carry around. The friction is measured in FMEP (friction mean effective pressure) which gives you the pressure required in the pistons to keep the engine spinning at a constant rate. FMEP times volume = Power per cycle needed to fight friction. Note that most of the mechanical losses come from the friction between the piston and the bore. The more pistons you have (V6 vs. I4) the more friction you will have. Note that the #of camshafts, #of valves and #of journal bearings also affect friction.",

      "context": "I know engine temperature should go down to \"C\" mark before opening radiator cap. However I'm finding that the temp just stays on normal for a long time. I think I've read people say you need to give an engine 30 minutes or so to cool down before you drain oil. However after more than 30 minutes my engine temp is still on normal. Is this normal? How long should I wait before I can expect an engine to cool down? When should I consider that I might have a problem and what type of problems might cause long cooling?",
      "answer": "The exact time taken depends upon various factors: The ambient temperature The amount of heat insulation in the engine bay Volume of coolant in the engine How hot the engine got while driving material used in construction of the engine block/head (aluminium blocks cool quicker than steel for example) and many more besides. Typically though it should be left to cool for 1-2 hours before it's cooled sufficiently to open the rad cap safely. If you're actually trying to check the coolant level then you probably need to wait more like 3-5 hours (as if the coolant is still warm it will show a falsely high reading due to expansion). I realise that sounds like an awful long time but you have to remember that after you turn the engine off a fair chunk of the residual heat from the engine is actually still being passed to the coolant (which is no surprise as the raison d'être of coolant is to remove heat from the engine!) and since you are no longer running the water pump and rad fans (in most cases - some cars will have after-run systems for these. Mine still runs the fans for quite along time after ignition off if the car has been driven hard for example) and there is no longer any significant airflow over the radiator (unless the wind happens to be blowing that way I guess) the cooling system's ability to remove heat from the coolant is a now purely passive and a fraction of what it is when the car is running. The reason you can do engine oil changes after only 30 mins is because you aren't waiting for it to be \"cold\" - in fact oil is much easier to change while still warm as viscosity drops and it will drain much easier and faster.",

Even if I take a supercar lighter and more aerodynamics it will consume more. But physicaly it require the same energy to drive constantly at 100 km/h, so does a more powerfull engine is less efficient ?",
      "answer": "A couple of things to contemplate: You need a certain amount of power at the wheels to maintain a certain speed. This assertion is (correctly) made in the question. At 100 km/h, a typical sedan would require roughly 10 hp at sea level to overcome the forces due to aerodynamic drag and maintain speed¹. The fact that an engine can produce 100 hp or 300 hp peak power is of no consequence. Who said that less powerful engines are more efficient? They might seem like that, but Rory is right; the assumption that engines producing less power are more efficient isn't always true. The concept of brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) helps us understand this, which is explained very nicely in this Hot Rod article. Simply put, BSFC is just engineer-speak for how much fuel is consumed by the engine per unit of energy². As the plot below shows, this number varies based on engine RPM. A smaller BSFC means better fuel economy. So how can a more powerful car sip less fuel at a given speed? Since each engine will have its own BSFC signature: The BSFC curve of the high-power engine could be lower. This will be especially true when comparing engines designed decades ago to modern-day marvels boasting things like EFI, variable-valve timing or forced induction. Gearing. If the BSFC curves are comparable, the gearing of the vehicle could mean that the RPM of the more powerful engine is in a more efficient part of the curve at a given speed. A classic example of this is the \"overdrive\" gear found in some vehicles to help improve fuel economy at highway speeds. ¹ - The Bosch Automotive Handbook explains how to estimate this ² - Alternatively, BSFC = fuel flow rate per unit power",

      "question": "Should we wait a few seconds before starting the engine?",
      "context": "My cousin told me when he enter his car, he put the key to ignition then count to 3 and start the engine. The main reason of him doing that is to give enough time to fluids (I'm not sure which one) to fill to the engine (I'm skeptic, need more info on this). He told me that in \"ze good ol'days\", car would sometimes fail to start if you directly turn the key to start engine and that even if they does start now, it is still better for the engine to wait a few seconds. This seems logical (although I doubt it's really something we should matter). Why is it better to wait a few seconds at ignition position before starting the engine?",
      "answer": "The only type of vehicle you need wait on is a diesel powered one. The reason for that is you need to wait (in most of them) for the glow plugs to heat the combustion chamber. Modern fuel injected cars will keep their fuel pressure after shutdown. It will stay there (usually) for a good 24 hours (Note: 24 hours is an approximation. It will take longer in some cars and less time in others for the fuel pressure to bleed off back into the fuel tank). When you turn the key on, the fuel pump will start running. This happens as fast as you turn the key. Oil doesn't start flowing until the engine is actually running, so if you tried to wait for that, you'd be waiting a lot longer than three seconds. Even with non-fuel injected cars there are no worries. In many older non-fuel injected cars, fuel pressure is not delivered until after the engine is turning over, so no sense in waiting for this to happen either. Cars with carburetors will continue to have fuel in their fuel bowls, so has a ready supply of fuel. Bottom line, I guess is this: it doesn't hurt anything to wait the three seconds, but you aren't creating any issues by not waiting. There will be no long term effects from starting it right after key insertion.",

      "question": "Will boring a cylinder affect its longevity thereafter?",
      "context": "I had to deal with a worn out cylinder recently and was suggested to bore the engine which seems perfectly normal. I am assuming the compression ratios will change so what do mechanics do to compensate for the change in cylinder dimensions? do they use the old piston or get a new one? What are the disadvantages of over boring a cylinder?",
      "answer": "Over boring the cylinder is a process to ensure the wall of the cylinder is pristine, providing a sealing surface for the rings to mate. Often when an engine gets old and tired, there will become scuffs in the the cylinder wall surface. This is an example of a scuffed cylinder wall: After boring and honing, the cylinder should look something like this: In the picture you can see the cross hatching. This is caused from the honing operation and helps the rings \"seat\" during the break in process. When the term \"seat\" is used, it means the ring is worn down slightly, allowing it to mate to the cylinder wall, and form a seal which holds compression in the cylinder/combustion chamber, as well as keeping oil out. A secondary purpose of boring the cylinder is to ensure it is completely round. To do this correctly, the shop should use a torque plate, which is attached to the deck during boring and final honing. This simulates the head being attached to the block during the process, so when the head is finally attached, all the little variances are accounted for and the cylinder is as close to round as can be made. I am assuming the compression ratios will change so what do mechanics do to compensate for the change in cylinder dimensions? The static compression ratio (CR) can be changed somewhat when the cylinder is bored. This is due to the small amount of difference from the over bore. When doing the calculations for the CR, the new volume from the enlarged cylinder must be taken into account. Even with the small amount overall which is seen when the piston is at top dead center (TDC), there will be a change, however slight. More than likely there will be other factors which will weigh heavier on the CR than just this, such as the dish or dome volume of the piston, combustion chamber size, and thickness of the head gasket. Do they use the old piston or get a new one? If you over bore the cylinder, you must use a new piston. When clearances of the piston to wall are measured",

The vibrations have nothing to do with engine knock or detonation though. The reason it stumbles is because those disabled pistons were expected to sustain the crank's rotation. In the absence of those pistons firing, the crank will experience rotational acceleration/deceleration. It is a good idea to disconnect the fuel injectors to those cylinders during the test to prevent unburnt hydrocarbons from reaching the catalytic converter.",

      "question": "Scatter Camshafts - What are they and why do I want one?",
      "context": "It seems in the world on mini's as in Mini Cooper, there is a camshaft called a scatter cam. It changes the timing for cylinders 2 and 3. I've heard of changing the timing to have 1 and 4 firing at the same time as well as 2 and 3 on 4-cylinder motorcycles but never changing just 1 and 4 or just 2 and 3. It doesn't seem that changing the way timing works on just two cylinders would have much benefit but I'm probably not looking at it right since it seems so many Mini Cooper owners want this done. So what am I missing here. Please make me smarter. What is a scatter camshaft? Why would you only change cylinder 2 and 3? What are the ultimate benefits to using this type of a camshaft? Why do they call them 'scatter cams'? TIA and Cheers!!",
      "answer": "To understand the question at large, it is first good to know what the application is and how it came about. The engine in question is the older type of 4-cylinder engine used in Series-A Minis (not the modern BMW manufactured one, but the one produced by the British Motor Corporation). This Mini used a specific head design which has a Siamese port configuration. The shared port work is where: Cylinders 1 & 2 share an inlet port Cylinders 3 & 4 share an inlet port Cylinders 2 & 3 share an exhaust port This image of a highly modified Series-A head shows what I'm talking about. You'll notice there are five ports. All of the ports are on the same side of the head. The square ports are exhaust ports and the round ports are intake ports. This somewhat strange configuration, while compact, has disadvantages. The two main problems being cross-port interference and flow potential. Cross-port interference stems from the shared aspect of some of the ports. For instance, depending on where the stroke is occurring in the Otto-cycle, the engine could be trying to perform an intake function in one port (at the end of the intake cycle) and one next to it could be starting its intake cycle. Both cylinders could be trying to intake at the same time, which would mean both might be getting starved from the potential air flow if they were using the port all by itself. Flow potential refers to how much air a single port is able to move. Since cyls 1 & 4 have their own exclusive exhaust port, they have better flow potential than does the shared exhaust port of cyls 2 & 3. Since there is no competition for the exhaust port, cyls 1 & 4 have better flow potential than does the single port shared by cyls 2 & 3. This brings us to the question: What is a scatter cam? There are single pattern camshafts where both the intake/exhaust lobes share the same profiles. The cam lobes open the same amount. They open and close for the same duration. A dual pattern camshaft is where there are two differen",

      "question": "Why is cold-start fuel mixture enrichment necessary?",
      "context": "I know a rich mixture is more fuel added than air in the ratio required (14.7:1), but how can it affect anything? I mean, if fuel is added but with no air it can't combust, so how can that affect the ease of starting an engine when cold? Since it isn't burning fuel inside, does it evaporate and expand? Or what happens?",
      "answer": "There are two issues with cold fuel: cold fuel is harder to vaporize (as HandyHowie mentions) cold fuel is likely to condense on cold engine parts, making its burning harder, less predictable So more fuel is added than necessary - using a richer AFR - in anticipation that a decent proportion of fuel will not be burned. In other words, during cold starts the effective AFR is leaner than expected, so the mixture is enriched to compensate for that The excess unburnt fuel is usually burnt through the addition of extra air (often called secondary air) in the exhaust, where the temperature of the combustion in the cylinder is sufficient to allow any fuel that remains in the exhaust gases to burn before reaching the catalytic converter. To quote the Bosch Fuel Injection & Engine Management book: Gasoline is less likely to vaporize when it is cold. Even if it is adequately vaporized, some fuel condenses on the cold parts of the engine before it can be burned. The engine requires extra fuel for starting so that, in spite of vaporization and condensation problems, the engine still receives a combustible air-fuel mixture.",

      "context": "Recently I came across the term \"knurled piston\" and I don't know what it means. What is a knurled piston? What is the difference between that and a normal piston? Why should you use a knurled piston rather than a regular piston (or not, as the case may be)?",
      "answer": "Knurling is a process where a cross-hatch stamp is pushed into metal. By doing this, the metal is compressed in some areas and raised in others. Here is a picture of a piston with a knurled portion in the side skirt: The main part of the piston (as in the picture) which gets knurled is the skirt. The reason someone would knurl a piston is one of two reasons. First, if they want the piston skirt to hold more oil while running. This can provide better lubrication to the cylinder walls and with the piston skirt. Second, and is more often the reason, people will have old pistons with worn skirts knurled to take up the slack where the worn part of the piston is at. This allows the piston to fit in the cylinder better than it would otherwise. This is only done during a rebuild where the engine builder is trying to skimp on parts. Since there is relatively little surface area on the piston skirt where the knurling is done which will actually touch the cylinder wall, this area will wear away fairly quickly (in the grand scheme of things). Knurling pistons is an \"old school\" technique which I don't think is used much in the modern era. Piston manufacturers are able to produce quality pistons at a cheap price so affording new pistons to replace old ones is a lot easier to accomplish. This is doubly so considering getting old pistons knurled costs you money ... the difference between new pistons and knurling is not that great. Besides decorative knurling, you can also find knurling done to valve guides to get a worn guide back into spec. This too, has ran its course and has fallen out of favor. One of the possible side effects of knurling your valve guides is if it's not done just right, can make your valve guide act like an oil pump and actually push excess oil into the cylinder. The guide also wears out rather quickly for the same reasons I talked about for the piston. Besides, you can get a valve guide insert done for a relatively cheap price.

      "context": "I have been looking at the power bands for my car (2000 Opel Agila 1.2) recently, as I want to work out when it is best to change gear and stuff, as I have no life! This is the approximate graph I made up in Excel comparing power and torque: Why does the power drop after about 5500 RPM? Why does the torque drop after 4000 RPM? I always thought higher speed means more power, so why don't they both keep increasing past these points? Note: The engine is naturally aspirated...",
      "answer": "Your engine was designed in such a way that it is most efficient between 3500RPM and 5000RPM. That means that the valve timing and camshaft profiles were made in such a way that your engine \"breathes\" best between those speeds. That's why you have the most torque in that region. Another thing is that as the RPM increases, it gets harder and harder to get the optimal amount of air and fuel into the cylinder AND burn it at the optimal rate. The faster the engine revs, the less time there is to suck in, compress, burn and blow out. This affects your ignition timing in turn, which means you start the burn process earlier than you want so that the flame dies just before the exhaust valve opens. Now, power is essentially just Torque X RPM, so it's just a matter of multiplying your engine speed by your torque to get the power and understand why your power curve looks the way it does.",

      "context": "The Gen 1 Small Block Chev gradually grew to 400cid. To achieve this massive volume the bores were siamesed and the conrods were shortened.The engine when produced in passenger car form had the same HP rating as the popular 350 but it made more torque making it better for the heavy cars it was used in .I would like answers to clarify or dispell all the rumours .",
      "answer": "The general thought with the 400ci SBC is, when they are overbored by more than .030\", you start running into overheating issues due to the Siamesed bores. This is not true. The overheating issue usually lies in the coolant passages (sometimes considered steam holes) which allow flow from the block to the head. These are very small holes which tend to get plugged up. Cleaning these holes out usually helps with overall coolant flow and help prevents overheating issues. Another issue which may come into play with boring these blocks past .040\" is wall thickness. Many of these blocks can accept an overbore of .060\", but must be completely sonic checked before hand. There are reports of boring right through into water jackets with thin walls. A good wall thickness is said to be in the .150\"+ range. A third issue which needs to be addressed with these engines is to ensure they are honed with a torque plate installed and properly torqued (with all fasteners). When this is done incorrectly or not done at all, these blocks are known to have oil control issues. By placing the torque plates prior to honing (after being bored over), you are ensuring the cylinders are completely round. This really applies to any block which you are having bored over. If a machine shop tells you not to worry about it or it doesn't really matter, take your business elsewhere, because this shop is lazy or doesn't know what they are talking about. Overall, the 400 SBC is a really good block. They do come with a bit shorter connecting rods (5.565\" compared to 5.700\" for the 350) than do most of the other SBC engines out there. I'm not too sure why GM built them this way, but it's okay. You can use the 5.7\" rods (way more plentiful and cheap), but you have to ensure the piston pin boss is offset or you'll run the piston through the head (think irresistible force meets immovable object).

If we go the next step, here are my questions: What are the various kinds of tappets / lifters? What are the advantages and disadvantages of each? Are there in fact engines that still have valves, but don't have lifters? (Some kind of arrangement where the valve step and spring follow the cam another way) I know there are solid tappets, hydraulic lifters, and roller tappets, are there other kinds?",
      "answer": "Not sure if this is what you were asking, but there are several configurations where there are no lifters (or at least, no push-rods) in an engine, where the valves are driven either through rocker arms or directly by the camshaft(s). Such a configuration is an OHC (overhead cam) configuration. SOHC are higher performance and lighter (and so typically have a higher rev range) than underhead cams with lifters. In SOHC (single overhead cam) setups you'll see a single camshaft driving rocker arms that actuate the valves: Whereas in DOHC (dual overhead cam) setups you'll see two cams directly driving the valves: DOHC valvetrains give the highest performance of conventional setups, and have the lowest inertia and so highest rev range, but they are somewhat more difficult to service due to the fact you need to keep the timing of the two camshafts in sync as well as each camshaft to the crankshaft timing. Not only that, the valve clearances on a SOHC can usually be adjusted by turning adjuster screws on the rocker arms, where on DOHC valvetrains you need to replace shims on the tappets to adjust valve clearance, which usually involves removing the camshaft(s). Now for tappets, you'll see shim-over-bucket, shim-under-bucket, hemispherical, and desmodromic (pretty much Ducati engines only, but very cool). Shim-over-bucket has a spacer shim on top of the tappet that is the contact piece for the camshaft or rocker arm, but this picture illustrates one of the downsides of this setup: At high speeds in DOHC configurations, it is possible for the swiping of the cam lobe across the shim to cause it to pop out of its slot and cause damage to the valvetrain. This problem is solved by shim-under-bucket tappets, which are similar but the shim is under the bucket (hence the name): Also seen here: There isn't a downside to using these as opposed to shim-over-bucket, except for the fact that shims can sometimes be removed from shim-over-bucket tappets without removing the camshaft, which",

Do I need to buy them separately or can I use the same ones that mate the engine to the transmission bellhousing? If I need to buy them what kind of bolts do I need to buy? Are they made of some special material or will regular bolts do? Where on the engine block do the bolts screw into? Despite extensive research online, I have yet to figure out what part of the engine block is used to attach to the engine stand. Is it the crank snout? Very puzzled by this. Do different engines have different mounting points? How does the same engine stand cater for different engines? I sometimes see this adapter-esque X-plate, but the bolt holes seem to slide fixed relative to one another. How do you operate the rotation mechanism ",
      "answer": "You will need to either reuse the bolts that attach the gearbox (transmission) to the engine, or if these are the wrong length buy some new bolts with the same thread pitch but at the correct length. You may need some washers too. As above, the stand will bolt to where the gearbox attaches to the engine. The part of the stand the engine actually bolts to is removable, so it can be attached with the engine on the ground or hanging from the crane. Then use your crane (or a few friends) to slide this part into the rotating assembly on the stand. One stand will adjust to cater for a range of engines as the arms which attach to the engine are adjustable, but bear in mind the designed weight of the stand. Heavy duty versions are available for big diesels etc... The whole assembly can be rotated with a handle and locked into position with a pin. More expensive versions have a geared rotation system that can be useful for fine adjustment or for heavy engines.",

This delta, whatever it is, seems to be a debate of how much. How much waste, how much efficiency, how much power. What are the actual deficiencies of a rotary engine? What is the delta of efficiency between a rotary engine and modern four-stroke engine? What is the root cause regarding the configuration of a rotary engine that makes it so wasteful?",
      "answer": "NOTE: Wankel engines are still Otto cycle engines (re: intake, compression, ignition, exhaust), they just perform the strokes differently than a valve controlled reciprocating engine. Lower Compression Ratio - It is known that a higher compression ratio provides more power without any other modification. This difference in compression ratio is said to be about 3% increase in output per 1 point of compression. This text book (page 14 of 21 [or page 274 of the text]) shows the compression ratio to be 6.98:1. That is typically giving up between 3-4 points of compression from what a stock piston engine can provide, with very little recourse to increase that number. (NOTE: While these figures show the lower compression ratio, Mazda has shown numbers to be as high as 10:1.) Shape of Combustion Chamber - In the following image, you can see the basic Otto cycle in the Wankel engine. Due to the inherent shape, when the air/fuel is ignited (between #3 & #4 cycles), the flame front is chasing the leading edge of the rotor around the combustion chamber, but never completely catches up with it. This allows some of the air fuel mixture to escape out of the exhaust port as that port is uncovered. This is why you can sometimes see flames coming from the exhaust of a rotary engined vehicle. Rotor Sealing - On the rotor itself, there are three main seals which keeps everything in check: apex seals, face seals, & side seals. (Below is an image showing their locations.) Keeping all of the gasses in their respective locations is a chore for the seals and the seals will usually lose some of that integrity. One of the reasons for this is because the seals have to keep hot and cold unmixed at the same time. Engine Oil Injection - In order to help in keeping a good seal, engine oil is injected directly during the intake cycle and in the intake tract. This provides proper sealing and decreased wear, but introduces inefficiencies in the burn of the air/fuel mixture, as well as creating more p",

      "answer": "The rotary engine is still a pump so opening it up helps it rev higher and make more power. Opening the inlet and exhaust ports is a big way to make more power at the engine. You still need the rest of the path to open up as well so opening the exhaust and intake path helps. Earlier Mazda RX-7s had anti pollution gear that killed power. There was a reburn chamber that spoiled the scavenging of the exhaust gases as it collected gases and burned off unburned hydrocarbons. I took that off and added straight pipe and made 5% more power. Just be careful as you do this the engine will just make more power as the RPM increase. You have to watch out for running gear like the RPM sending gear (on the '78s anyway) was plastic and wouldn't take the extra revs. There was a brass after market replacement though. Big the key is to open up the engine to let it rev higher to make more power. There is a point where your apex seals will wear faster but for race work that's not bad.

When did they start using these kinds of valve trains? Does this mean they don't have camshafts and are controlled by a computer?",
      "answer": "First, it's probably important to review what valves do and how they're supposed to work on a four stroke internal combustion engine. What valves do Essentially there are intake valves and exhaust valves with a minimum of one of each per piston, but F1 cars (and many modern road cars) use two of each. The following description will use \"valve\" singular, but it should be understood that in multi-valve engines, the valves operate in synchrony -- that is, whether the engine has one or two intake valves, they are in the same position at each instant in time. The intake valve allows the fuel/air mixture into the cylinder as the piston moves down (away from the valve) and then closes so that the mixture can be compressed by the rising piston. It's then ignited by a spark and the resulting mini-explosion pushes the piston back down. That's the power stroke. Finally, the piston comes back up as the exhaust valve opens and the exhaust gas is pushed out of the cylinder. How they work As should be obvious from the above description, the valves must be exactly synchronized to the operation of the pistons moving up and down. If they were to get out of synchronization, the engine would have less power (if they're slightly off timing), or not run at all (if they're grossly off timing) or destroy the engine by causing the pistons to crash into the valves, bending or breaking the valves (in some designs). For many decades, and up to the current time, most engines use cams to push the valve down (opening it) and springs to close the valve again. It's inexpensive, reliable, efficient and a well-proven design, but there are limitations. Let's go racing! When engine speeds go up, the valves have to go faster. An F1 car is designed to rotate up to 15,000 RPM according to the current regulations; previous seasons' cars revved even higher. Typical road-going cars have \"red line\" at around half that. (\"Red line\" refers to an actual red line on the tachometer which is intended to indicate \"i",

      "question": "Computing Wheel Torque From Engine Torque",
      "context": "It seems possible to obtain engine torque and RPM from a truck CAN bus. I'd like to estimate tractive force at the wheels given these two values. How should I go about computing torque at the wheels? Wouldn't I need gear ratio, which doesn't seem obtainable from the CAN bus? (also asked this question on physics.stackexchange)",
      "answer": "The basics are quite simple. The motor generates a certain torque N and a certain power P at a given RPM. Further more, the relation between power and torque is: P = C * N * RPM where C is a constant to convert all that odd units. For N, P in SI units, it is C = pi / 30 Neglecting any losses, Power is conserved from the motor to the wheels so you can say C * N_motor * RPM_motor = C* N_wheel * RPM_wheel N_wheel = N_motor * RPM_motor / RPM_wheel The RPM of the wheel can easily be derived from speed and the rolling circumference of the wheel R_wheel. (Keep in mind, the rolling circumference is smaller than the geometrical circumference, as the tire is flexible. Since you are more interested in the tractive force F_wheel, it is N_wheel = F_wheel * R_wheel and so F_wheel = N_motor * RPM_motor / (RPM_wheel * R_wheel) As it's also v = pi * RPM_wheel * R_wheel / 30 (velocity in m/s) you can write F_wheel = N_motor * RPM_motor * pi / (v * 30) This means, if you really have the torque the motor currently delivers, the RPM of the motor and the speed of the truck, you can calculate the total force applied to the street. It's strange that gear ratios don't appear, but they are hidden in the ratio RPM_motor / RPM_wheel or RPM_motor / v. In reality, there are lots of non neglible losses, as Paulster2 wrote in his comment. Every bearing and every gear wheel has some friction, taking away some torque and power. If this torque is constant, the power loss will be linear to the RPM of this part, but usually, torque will increase with RPM, so the power loss grows even faster with RPM. This means the loss is not constant, it varies with RPM and gear! One interesting fact: A clutch transfers power / torque by friction. For a slipping clutch, torque is the same on both shafts, but power is lost due to the difference in RPM... And to make it clear again: You do need the measured torque from the motor, max torque at given RPM is not what you need.",

The simple answer was that electric cars produce peak torque at any RPM but the gasoline engine needs to rev up to certain RPM to churn out similar power & torque figures. Can someone explain why is it so?",
      "answer": "Torque in almost all electric machines is a function of current. For permanent magnet machines, torque is roughly proportional to current and for the series-wound machines, torque is roughly proportional to current squared. So if you can get the current in quickly which is easiest at standstill, you will burn rubber.",

      "question": "How to amplify car speakers without stereo?",
      "context": "I have a 1980 VW Dasher with its original speakers but no radio. It has an unusual (erroneous?) electrical configuration where most accessories (e.g. lights, cabin fan, etc) still run even with the ignition switched off and key removed (I've heard that's just how old VWs work, but never confirmed that). This results in the problem that installing any aftermarket radio or amplifier will run the battery down if I connect it in the conventional way. So 2 related issues here: 1) I don't really want a radio. I'd actually be just fine with some sort of simple, low-power amplifier that can drive the speakers, which I could plug a smartphone or something into (like with a TRS connector or whatever) to play music and whatnot. Has anyone had any success doing something like that? What kinds of products should I look for? Right now I don't even know what such a thing would be called. \"Amplifier\" encompasses too many different products. 2) I need to put my own toggle switch into this system someho",
      "answer": "What you need is a simple switch. Here's an example of one that you can order from DigiKey. Your radio will use two wires for powering itself, the ground (GND) and V+. The ground wire should be grounded, that is connected to negative (-) terminal of the battery. The V+ wire should be connected to one connector of the switch. Battery positive terminal (+) should be connected to the other connector of the switch. Switch will simply short-circuit positive battery terminal to the radio when turned on. This is the simplest solution that I can think of. Well, there is a simpler one, using just bare wires and connecting them when needed, but I guess that would be somewhat weird solution.",

      "answer": "Yes you can often repair turn signal flashers! A variety of things can be wrong: here's one of them. Solder joints on the relay printed circuit boards are especially vulnerable to stress cracks, due to the clicking motion day in and day out. Take the case off the relay and use a jeweler's loupe to inspect for hairline cracks, especially cracks those that go all the way around a pin that is shaken by the relay clicking. For example: To repair get a soldering iron fairly hot, melt the existing solder until it is fully wet, release cleanly, and let the solder form a nice shiny fillet. This is a very easy soldering job even for beginners.",

      "context": "I want to do some electrical mods like adding a push/pull switch to my truck' tailgate to wire into my door ajar light to let me know if it is open along with splicing an electrical tailgate lock into the door auto lock mechanisms. To do this I need to test for which wires are active during these certain things. I do not have a lot of experience with electrical. Do I need a full multimeter with piercing probes, or is it enough to get a non-contact low voltage test light to test the individual wires in the harness for when the lock is pressed etc?",
      "answer": "This is quite easy, but you need to do yourself a favor and get a factory wiring diagram. It will save you hours of frustration and confusion. The factory wiring diagrams will tell you exactly when the circuits are active and when they aren't. On top of that they will tell you the colors and sometimes the current flow. You really don't want to hook up a tail light to a fan circuit (Personal experience) =P Once you have that, you'll need some thin wire probes or insulation piercing probes. They come with the Power Probe 3, and fluke also sells them. A decent multi-meter should help you track down the wires you want to use. If you decide that you want to use your own method to pierce the wires, just remember to wrap them in high temp electrical tape. When insulation gets compromised the entire wire inside it can corrode. It's a real pain to try and figure that out. If you want to try to sort this out the oldschool way you can use the multi-meter, probes, and a test light. Essentially what you would do is attach your test light or multi-meter to to ground, activate the circuit and test each wire individually. BUT I don't recommend doing this. As I said before, if you put a lock mechanism on a fan circuit that might intermittently kick on, you'll have some serious issues. You could possibly even put it on an EVAP circuit, which would probably mess with the EVAP without realizing it and every time you put gas in your car, your tailgate would drop. I would get wiring diagrams, there are so many wires in a vehicles it's really hard to do it the oldschool way. http://www.eautorepair.net/ That website carries a lot of factory wiring diagrams.

I've literally tried to start the car 5 times, then unplugged my phone, tried again, and it always starts. My guess is that it is somehow causing interference or diverting power that is meant for a device critical to the starting of the car. Any ideas where to start looking?

      "question": "How to track down an intermittent battery drain?",
      "context": "I know there are several questions on here about finding the source of a battery drain (like Battery drains by itself when vehicle is parked (parasitic draw) ). However I don't think the answers address my problem. Occasionally when I go to use my car in the morning, it will have a dead battery. Because it is an intermittent problem (on the order of once every couple of months), it's no surprise that mechanics find nothing when doing an overnight draw test. That is to say that the problem has never occurred when the car is in the shop. FWIW, I have not left the lights on on the nights that the battery drains. I can't rule out any similarly stupid mistake, but at least its not the lights. Also, we tried the simple step of replacing the battery about 6 months ago. The load tests done by various mechanics never implicated the battery, but we did it anyway. So my question is, what strategies should I use to track down an intermittent battery draining draw?",
      "answer": "You could set up a low voltage relay in-line on the battery ground cable (obviously only for when parked at night). Even a small current from an activated circuit (like the door light) should cause the relay to trip. Use the relay to turn on an alarm so you can go see what's causing the draining. If you don't have a relay, a flashlight lightbulb wired in series with the ground cable will do the same thing, show when current is flowing. A multimeter is more sensitive, but you have to watch it carefully. It will always register a few milliamps to keep the radio stations set but if it goes up, you will know. It's going to take some testing with a multimeter to tell how much voltage will develop during small current draws, but it's probably at least 10 watts to drain a healthy battery overnight during the summer. Use the dome light to calibrate. I had to use this method last year and the culprit was the remote locking system picking up my wife's keys somehow and activating the lock solenoid all night long.",

      "question": "Squeaky Brakes: How much of a concern are they?",
      "context": "I recently bought a 1998 Jeep Grand Cherokee from a dealership. When we bought it, I noticed that the brakes were not working very well, and the dealer fixed them before we finalized, putting in a completely new system. However, my wife, who is the primary driver of the vehicle, has been complaining almost from that very day about squeaky brakes. I'm not wanting to take it anywhere, because I know the brakes are fairly new. How much of a concern are squeaky brakes?",
      "answer": "It's not a concern really other than being annoying if in fact the brakes are new. It's not a difficult fix; just putting disk brake quite on the back of the pads should solve the problem. It should have been done when they did the brake job, so I would take it back to the dealer where you bought it and ask them to fix it. At my place it would be done at no charge to you if we had just done the brake job. It's worth noting the brake squeal this question is referring to is when the brakes are applied. Brake squeal that goes away when you apply the brakes and comes back when you release them is the wear indicators meaning that your brake pads need to be replaced. Sometimes a loud noise or high pitch squeal occurs when the brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is produced by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Simple techniques like adding chamfers to linings, greasing or gluing the contact between caliper and the pads (finger to backplate, piston to backplate), bonding insulators (damping material) to pad backplate, inclusion of a brake shim between the brake pad and back plate, etc. may help to reduce squeal.

He said that I have to use brakes only when needed (when I need to stop or in case of emergency). Is it correct? Could downshifting without braking damage the clutch? PS: I'm also doubtful about this because when you downshift without hitting the brake, the red lights on the back of the vehicle do not turn on, so people behind you cannot understand that you're slowing down.",
      "answer": "So there are several aspects to keep in mind if you use engine braking. No brake lights! Don´t do this when somebody sits at your back! Don´t over-rev. Only downshift to an appropriate gear. Never use force to engage the gear. Downshifting and releasing the clutch when cornering hard can lead to unexpected behavior. You are braking only one axle, you´ll get oversteer/understeer depending on the kind of drive-system. No Anti-lock! You´ll trade clutch-lifetime against brake-lifetime. You can reduce wear on the clutch if you give the gas a little pinch before re-engaging the clutch. The clutch wear only happens during the short slipping moment upon engaging - so this is a good trade off when you are going downhill for example. You use absolutely no fuel, when engine-braking as opposed to the motor idling while disc-braking. This leads to using the engine brake only in certain situations. When you are cruising and see a red light or speed limit up ahead to gently slow down. Or when you go downhill, to save the brakes from overheating. It´s not a good alternative in any situation where you need a swift or finely controlled slowdown!",

      "answer": "As already stated, get the estimate on paper with parts and labor broken down. Go to another shop and get an estimate, tell them reasons related to your car of why you want the estimate, not \"i have this estimate, can you do better\". If you've noticed vibration under heavy braking, noises or just reached the number of miles where you want them checked for safety. Then compare the two and armed with that information, you can question either shop about the differences. \"Hey Dealership, explain to me why you want to replace the rotors but Shop B is going to just turn them?\" They might say they are showing signs of damage, too much warping, too thin or \"we can just turn them if that is what you want but next time you will need to replace them\". There will be two big differences between the dealer and a local shop. Parts cost of OEM vs Aftermarket. OEM are going to be more expensive then Aftermarket \"OEM Equivalent\" parts (ones built to meet the OEM specs) but will be cheaper then upgraded Aftermarket parts (larger rotors, slotted, drilled, etc). Neither the dealership or a local shop should change their labor cost if you purchase the parts yourself (as long as there isn't additional work created by what you choose) so go ahead and shop around too. Depending on what kind of markup they put on their parts, you can save some money this way. Labor cost should be higher at the dealership. In some situations it might be worth it to pay the people that are trained for your vehicle, a brake job isn't typically one of those. If you want to go the DIY route, brake jobs are remarkably easy, but I wouldn't go at it alone your first time, we are talking about the device that stops your car after all. Find a friend that has done it before, doesn't have to have been on a Honda and ask them to go through it with you or someone that is about to do theirs and ask to watch and be an extra set of hands. Once you've seen it through once, you won't need to pay for a brake job ever again. If ",

If you're going the wrong speed and the engine RPMs aren't even close to what they need to be, the syncros might have a hard time lining everything up and you could hear a little grinding, and cause a little wear, but it still shouldn't cause any major damage if you only do it accidentally a few times.

      "answer": "If you match revs correctly you should be able to change gear with no ill effects at all. The challenge is of course to match revs. This is pretty easy when accelerating, but when decelerating you'll need to use the accelerator to bump the engine revs up to match. Google for heel-and-toe (this also helps make for faster downshifts when using the clutch) Getting started into first is tricky though. If your clutch does fail, parking on a down hill can help with this:-)",

      "question": "Motorcycle transmission occasionally pops out of gear",
      "context": "I'm having an issue where the transmission will occasionally downshift by itself during a fast acceleration. I have a 2005 Suzuki Vstrom 650 and it's been a great bike so far. At pretty high revs, 9k-10k or so, it will occasionally go from 2nd -> Neutral, and I think the same thing happened once going 6th -> 5th gear. What is causing this to happen and how can I fix it?",
      "answer": "I've had this on a few bikes and it can happen for a few reasons. If it it's only happened a couple of times i wouldn't be too worried. I've had a 'false neutral' when changing gears and instead of engaging the next gear the gears don't quite engage and you end up between them. Older bikes with higher mileage might be more prone to this. To avoid it make sure you're giving the lever good positive pressure and moving it the full distance of lever travel. It it also seems to help the gears engage if you hold pressure on the gear lever a little longer as you release the clutch. And maybe be a bit more gentle on the throttle when changing. I have had bikes jump out of gear as you describe on a couple of occasions. I put it down to not having the gear properly engaged. I had 1 bike that had a badly worn gearbox. 2nd gear was so badly worn that it would jump teeth. The edges of the gear dog teeth were rounded. I had the gearbox stripped down and had the gears 'undercut'. This puts a fine angle on the mating surfaces of gear teeth which means that under load they positively engage. This is not a simple task and should only be entrusted to an experienced specialist. If it becomes a regular occurrence for you, you might be looking at a gearbox rebuild. Im not a vstrom expert but its possible there might be some adjustment or tolerances that might make a difference. Maybe even play in worn bearings might be a factor. But as I said at the start if it's only happened a few times i wouldn't be too concerned.",

      "question": "Why did manufacturers go to other than 1:1 transmission ratios?",
      "context": "While reading this question it came to mind: Why did manufacturers start building transmissions without a 1:1 ratio? In the older transmission you'd see the 1:1 ratio all the time, either as the final drive ratio or the one just before the overdrive. Is there a reason for this, either technically, mechanically, or financially? Seems to me it would cost more to create your transmission as such because a 1:1 (to me) would entail less gearing*. Power in = Power out ... help me to understand? *Note: By gearing here, I probably should have said engineering.",
      "answer": "Gearbox designers should avoid integer ratios like the plague. For mechanical reasons. Integer ratios will accelerate wear and tear because it increases the frequency with which tooth A on the driver gear will meet tooth B on the driven gear. This frequency is known as the hunting tooth frequency, which I've explained in more detail here. Regarding 1:1 1:1 is a special case known as direct-drive. The input shaft is locked with the output shaft, so the above argument doesn't really apply. I believe Wikipedia sheds some reasonable light on this matter: In an era when different models of car with different wheel sizes could be accommodated by simply changing the final drive ratio, it made sense for all transmissions to use direct drive as the highest gear. As noted earlier, however, this would cause the engine to operate at too high an RPM for efficient cruising. Although adding the cruising gear to the main gearbox was possible, it was generally simpler to add a separate two-gear overdrive system to the existing gearbox. This not only meant that it could be tuned for different vehicles, but had the additional advantage that it could be offered as an option, which was easy to add. I interpret that to mean there are a few motivating factors at play (denoted in brackets): 1:1 isn't sufficient as a final gear ratio because the resultant engine RPM is too high for the cruising speeds of modern vehicles (mechanical) It is simpler to design the gearbox to have two overdrive gears than have direct drive with one overdrive gear (cost, manufacturing, engineering) A design with two overdrive gears is easier to tune for different vehicles, making the same gearbox design more universal (cost)",

      "question": "Why am I not moving after starting car and shifting to Drive?",
      "context": "So I have had this issue for the last couple months where when I first start the car, shifting to Drive (automatic transmission) doesn't do anything. Pressing the gas only revs the engine, as if in neutral. Shifting down to low gears (1 and 2) has the same outcome. Reverse performs as expected, I can back up with no problem. Only after a few minutes of idling does the car slowly, almost grudgingly, pull away. I checked trans fluid and I'm good, and I don't see any leaks. Since I have been coping with this problem for a while, I did notice a few things. 1. The car will only move once my rpms (while in Drive) drop below 1000. 2. Upon first starting the car and shifting to Drive, I originally idle at about 1500, then as the engine warms I steadily drop until I start to move (below 1000). 3. Revving up to about 4000 rpms decreases the time it takes to \"warm up\" and drop the needle below 1000. So my questions are (a)what could be the cause? My gears obviously aren't connecting until a certa",
      "answer": "If there is no feeling of moving at all, not even that little lurch forward when things are working correctly, it sounds like your transmission is having a serious issue. Nothing says it's dead, too early for that yet. When you look at the transmission fluid, what color is it? Does it smell burnt? It should be a nice bright red, and not have the burnt smell. If this is true, you may have a problem with the transmission solenoids, bad vacuum lines, or some other things. That would be good news ans these fixes are relatively inexpensive compared to a transmission rebuild. If it's not the solenoids, or vacuum lines, you should probably take it in and have it looked at. Find a reputable local shop that specializes in transmissions. This is not something you want the dealer to handle, and if it needs a rebuild, you don't want just any old shop doing it. I had a Cadillac where the transmission was just another consumable.

      "context": "I left a 2001 V6 Honda Accord unrun for ~4 months (I don't have a license). Naturally, the battery is dead. I have heard that letting the alternator charge the battery from empty like this puts unnecessary wear on the alternator, so it is best to get a shop charge. Since I don't have a license I can't get it to a shop... Would it work to fully charge the battery off of a jumper battery (specifically I have access to a jump-n-charge 660, which has 1700 peak amps and 425 cranking amps. http://www.cloreautomotive.com/sku.php?id=244). About how long would it take to charge the engine battery (approximately of course. An hour? 6 hours? 12 hours?). Is there risk of overcharging the engine battery like this?",
      "answer": "Use the jumper battery to start the engine, then disconnect it and leave the engine running (with no current drain such as lights, heater fan, radio, etc). The car should charge its own battery to 80% charge in about two hours (assuming the battery and alternator are in good condition; the battery may be damaged by being uncharged for so long, but I've never had that issue.) Doing it this way won't damage anything, and if the car is not on a road, you can't be done for being in charge of a car while unlicensed. Those jump batteries are generally intended for getting the car started; if you want to keep the battery in the car charged, look for a 'trickle charger'.",

      "question": "Portable jumpstart kits: why aren&#39;t regular car batteries this small?",
      "context": "I was looking at the details of this jumpstart product: It claims to be 2 lbs and 14.2 x 12 x 3.5 inches, which I think is for the outer black canvas case, so I would guess the actual device is less than 9.5 x 5.5 x 3 inches. I assume this is a Li-Ion battery. Conversely, a standard lead-acid battery for a common small car is 9.4 x 5.1 x 8.8 inches - 3 times as big, and maybe 10 times as heavy (This is BCI form factor 51R which is used by the 2015 Honda Civic). I assume the different battery chemistry accounts for the smaller size of the jumpstarter. Why do modern cars not use this smaller battery type? Looking at the amazon link it doesn't seem to be a matter of cost - the jumpstarter price is in a similar ballpark to what one would pay for the 51R lead-acid battery.",
      "answer": "The two biggest disadvantage of lead acid batteries compared to the newer types like Li Ion are that they are heavier, and that they contain liquid acid. Another possible issue is that they can produce hydrogen gas. On the other hand, they are very inexpensive, have a long life expectancy, have a very high tolerance for overcharging without being damaged, and they hold a charge longer than other types. They are also able to handle high discharge rates. Here are some comparison charts Looking at the disadvantages, you can see that they're mostly irrelevant in a car. The weight of the battery is trivial compared to the weight of the rest of the components. Being able to stand long periods of slow charging without damage, and being able to sit unused for long periods of time without losing charge are ideal properties for a car battery. Being light weight and packing a lot of energy into a small package are just not that important for a car, but they're critical for portable devices, and this jump starter is in fact a portable device. Looking at the cost of this jump starter and comparing it to the cost of a lead acid battery is not really realistic, because this device would not be able to start your car daily for years without failing. You'd be replacing it much more frequently. That said, it's definitely true that newer battery technologies are showing up in cars, especially hybrids and electric vehicles. But those don't need jump starts, and for most ICEs, the lead-acid battery still provides the most reliable and durable option.",

      "answer": "Depends where you drove, it might simply be an issue with the battery needing more of a charge than your trip could give it. That said, regular car batteries don't take too kindly to deep discharging and if it was fairly old and nearing the end of its life already, it might have just pushed it over the edge. I'd put the battery on a decent charger until the charger reports that the battery is fully charged and see if it works again.

      "answer": "tl dr: Corrosion (once cleaned) is not a huge issue. It is just typical corrosion on the battery terminal. See this image: (NOTE: This is a 6V battery, but the same principles apply.) The blueish color you see is hydrated copper sulfate. When acid vapors escape from the battery, it can cause a reaction with any copper which may be in the terminal. The other side is white(ish) because it is lead sulfate. I believe the reason why it happens the way it does is due to how the electrons flow through the battery, which can cause one or the other metal to react more.

      "answer": "Unless you give the make and model of your battery, it's not possible to give you specifics. However, most of the info should be printed on the label, and you can also generally go to the battery manufacturer's web site and look at the actual specs. Most car batteries are \"12V\" (not really exact, and also depending on remaining charge and current draw) but there are many systems out there so there's not really a general answer. Plus even if we choose to say \"12V is a safe bet\" for voltage, the general capacity, max current, reserve capacity, CCA, ability of battery to perform in cold conditions, etc., can vary a lot. So, you'll have to go look up your battery on the mfr site or check the label. Here are some of the typical stats (as well as definitions take from here): Cranking Amps (CA) - A rating that is used to define the battery's ability to start an engine in moderate temperature conditions. BCI defines it as \"the discharge load in amps that a new, fully-charged battery at 32ºF (0ºC) can continuously deliver for 30 seconds while maintaining a terminal voltage equal to or higher than 1.20 volts per cell.\" This artificially high rating should not be confused with CCA, which is conducted at 0ºF (-17.8ºC). Cold-Cranking Amps (CCA) - A rating that is used to define the battery's ability to start an engine under low-temperature conditions. BCI defines it as \"the number of amps a lead-acid battery at 0ºF (-17.8ºC) can deliver for 30 seconds and maintain at least 1.2 volts per cell (7.2 volts for a 12-volt lead-acid battery). Nominal Voltage - The rated voltage of a battery Closed-Circuit Voltage (CCV) - The voltage of a battery when the cell or battery is under a specific discharge load and time interval. See also Open-Circuit Voltage. Reserve Capacity (RC) - BCI defines it as \"the number of minutes a new, fully-charged battery at 80ºF (27ºC) can be discharged at 25 amps and maintain a voltage equal to or higher than 1.75 volts per cell\" (i.e., 10.5 volts for a 12-vol",

Having said that, there are a few things to consider. Reduce the amount of waste that you generate where possible. The best thing I can suggest for reducing the amount of waste you need to safely dispose of is simply to reduce the amount of waste that you generate, and plan ahead to minimize the waste - especially from stuff that has a finite shelf life. Here are some good things you can do to improve your mess making methodology generally (not just including how to clean the cylinder heads, axle bearings, calipers and crankcases that you listed - but also more common thing like your own service, oil change, filters etc. because I think it would be more useful information for more people): Catch the Excess - If you change your own car oil then you probably have something that you use to catch the oil (such as an oil drain pan) as it comes oil of the car. Depending on what you are doing, you might be able to use an old bucket or large container of some sort to catch the chemicals. If you can contain them as you go instead of making a mess to clear up after you've finished working, it will be easier to dispose of them properly. An old sheet or mat you don't really care about could also work well to avoid quite so many chemicals being deposited straight in to land fill. Oil Disposal - You can recycle old oil through local oil distributors and auto-repair stations. Antifreeze - Take antifreeze to a household hazardous waste collection program, or you can check with local automotive repair shop or garage for advice. If your lucky they might take it off your hands there and then! Car Batteries - Recycle car batteries at the stores that sell them. The toxic lead in car batteries can contaminate groundwater.

Check for excessive smoke (oil getting into the bores), coolant loss (coolant getting into the bores) and a mayonnaise effect in the oil (coolant getting into the oil) You don't say what car you have, but for quite a lot of vehicles, particularly older ones, that is a do-able job for a reasonably competant diy mechanic. You'll generally need a decent manual, a gasket set & new head bolts, a Torque wrench and a selection of sockets, and make sure to follow the loosening/tightening sequence given in the manual. It is best to get the head checked and/or skimmed by an engineering shop, but you can usually get away without if it isn't too bad a blow.",

      "answer": "This is not a serious issue. You can probably even get by using 0W-30, especially since you are in an area which is usually warm. If you were in a colder area up north somewhere, I'd highly suggest you change it out. If you do decide to change it out, don't worry too much about the filter. I'd take the filter down and drain out what's in it, but put some clean oil back on the gasket and put it back in. The little bit of leftover 0W-30 is not going to cause any issues. One of the issues with running a heavier weight oil is that your bearing clearances are set by the factory to accept the thinner oil. By having the thicker oil in the crankcase, you run the risk of bearing damage. I think with where you live the chance is mighty small, but it's still there. If your car is really new, I'd highly suggest you change the oil out. When a car is newer, the bearing tolerances are even tighter. Seeing as how your car is a 2014, there has probably been at least three or four oil changes done to it, so it shouldn't be an issue.",

Finally decided to see if I had anything left in the overflow to see how much I'd lost on the drive home. It was overflowing! Here's the weird things: Temperature gauge was perfectly normal the entire drive home, not high, not low. The coolant in the overflow was cold (room temperature), I expected it to be hot. No smell of coolant burning/cooking off either. Once the engine cools down I plan on checking the oil cap for residue and the dipstick for level/residue, but if it was a headgasket the coolant should be hot. Ditto for thermostat & fans.

Could I comission a local metal working buissness to make a 'tube' that would fit my exhaust system? I'm basically looking for a build that will let my engine breathe better and will sound nice. What should I take into account when doing so? The law in my country doesn't take emissions or noise into account on cars classified as classics. Edit: Another aproach to this would be removing the exhaust and taking it in to the buisness, would driving without an exhaust be sensible in any way?",
      "answer": "Possibilities Yes! Absolutely you can have this done. The quality of work may vary depending on the level of experience of the shop you commission to do the work but you could end up with something like this, if you want. I would not remove the entire exhaust and take it to a shop. How are they going to know where the exhaust should run without having the engine bay and frame available to measure everything up to ensure it fits into the engine bay correctly? Running the engine with no exhaust is not good for your exhaust valves. Exhaust fumes from your engine bay will get into the cabin and you will be breathing in some very noxious fumes that kill living organisms, that being you and whomever else get's in. Keep the header/manifold If you can use your current exhaust manifold that comes off your cylinder head, that's the most cost effective and reliable way. You don't want anyone fabricating that piece. You would then cut off the beginning of your exhaust pipe that bolts up to the manifold to use that. Your fabricator can then weld tubing that is the same as the current diameter of your exhaust pipe to that connector piece so it can bolt up to your manifold with the right connection. Add in a muffler You can then weld a muffler into the system. It's level of restriction may force you to tune your carburetor to match the restriction in the muffler. More backpressure will richen your system. Less will lean it out. You don't want to run rich or lean. Rich wastes fuel Lean runs hot, more oxygen, and can damage your exhaust valves and 'burn' them. Here's a QA on burnt valves What exactly is a \"burnt valve\" and what causes it? Conclusion Yes. You can do it. Put a muffler in it too, you need the restriction and the back pressure. If you love the planet, put a catalytic converter in it. You will probably have to tune your air fuel ratio to get things proper after you install your exhaust.

I know what the major components are and what they do, but I don't know if and when certain exhaust parts became mandated or introduced over time. I love how a throaty late-60's/early-70's muscle car exhaust sounds. Gnarly, a bit raspy, yet throaty and with some oomph. But when I hear most current muscle cars - 90s and on - the exhaust is mostly deep and loud, with little of the raw or explosive sound that the classic cars have. The classic muscle cars sound very similar to an inboard/outboard boat engine, where the contemporary muscle cars rarely achieve that note. A few examples to describe what I notice...

      "answer": "It has very little to do with the exhaust system and much to do with the mechanics of the engine. All modern muscle cars have aluminium blocks (vs cast iron), round exhaust ports (vs rectangle), and completely different timing set ups than 60s cars have. The firing order makes a big difference because nobody fires 2 in a row on the same side of the engine anymore. Thus engines have much better balance now and are smoother sounding. It's also one of the reasons red lines are so much higher. The thin walled aluminium blocks and heads resonates sound much differently than cast iron did and even things like 6 bolt mains change engine resonance through the block giving you a tighter tinny sound. Of course just like air blowing over valves in a trumpet the shape of the combustion chambers and round exhaust ports changes the exhaust note too. In short the only way to get the 60s sound is with a 60s car. For what it's worth I have tried nearly everything to get my LS1 Miata to sound like a real muscle car!",

      "question": "Effects of leaky exhaust valves",
      "context": "While rebuilding my valves, I noticed that 4 out of 6 exhaust valves on one side of the V6 engine were leaking after lapping and I had to relap them. I determined that by doing a water test. I am guessing they were leaking even before (IOW that the leaking wasn't a result of a poor lapping job) which sounds tenable because the exhaust ports looked like a mess before I cleaned them. The fact that none of the intake valves leaked led me to a conclusion that exhaust valves take more heat so they are more likely to need readjustment. But what are some effects of leaky exhaust valves? E.g. I underwent the complete head gasket and valve rebuild procedure because my engine was overheating and the head gaskets got fried. My speculation was that was because of a stuck thermostat that caused overheating. But could it have been due to leaky exhaust valves?",
      "answer": "Under normal use (non-performance type use), the valves, both intake and exhaust, should last the life of the engine. If and when they do leak, it will not take long for the valve to become a burnt valve. In your case, I doubt they were leaking prior to pulling everything apart. If the exhaust valves had leaked, they would have been fried. If valves do not seat correctly, they will not transmit heat through the head as they are supposed to and will become very hot, thus causing the \"burnt valve\" syndrome. It wouldn't take the engine 5-years for this to occur, but rather months if not weeks for it to actually start causing you issues (if not less time). Even if the exhaust valves were leaking, this would not have caused the overheating issue you were experiencing. Valves transmit heat into the heads through proper seating. If they aren't seating correctly, you'd have experienced less heat traveling into the heads through valve transfer. As well, you'd been seeing lower compression in the affected cylinders due to bleed off during the compression stroke (slight bleed off until a valve gets very burned, but bleed off none the less). Due to this loss of dynamic compression, you'd have not been seeing as good of power coming from that cylinder, as well as a reduction in heat. This reduction would not have been great, but it would still be less than optimal. During normal use, valves spin as they are used (not spin as in a top would spin, but they do rotate). This actions provides that they do not sit still, helps clean off of the seats and faces, which helps it to continue to seat throughout its lifespan. I don't think your exhaust valves leaked due to a poor lap job, but probably an incomplete lap job after you mixed your valves up. I'm sure if they were put into the same holes they came out of, your valves would have had no issues what-so-ever. When you clean up your valves during the rebuild process, even though you may keep the valves in the same positions, lapping i",

Also, can I power the air conditioning compressor and dashboard of my car through the same socket, and when my engine is also off? I plan to set up an AC to DC converter to do that. Is it electrically dangerous? Thank you.",
      "answer": "Yes, it is possible to charge the battery through a cigarette lighter socket, but there is a couple of caveats: The car's circuitry must have the lighter socket \"live\". It may require setting the ignition switch to \"accessories.\" The charge rate must be kept low enough not to blow a fuse associated with the lighter socket (often 10 Amps). At 10 A it is going to take several minutes to get a depleted battery charged enough to crank the engine successfully. There are commercial products that work on this principle. However, it seems you do not so much want to charge the battery but to keep it charged while running electrical devices. This is possible, but the 10 A limit means you can not go over 135 W of sustained total power draw without depleting your battery. The air conditioning compressor is driven by a belt drive from the engine, so you cannot run that from a purely electric source. There may be AC compressors that may be powered by either AC electricity or by the engine. The blower that circulates the air is electric and can be powered from the battery. The dashboard is mostly electric, the only bits I can imagine being of use in a stationary vehicle are the entertainment system and the clock. They can be powered this way.",

A vacuum pump like this one pictured below can be helpful in finding the problem. You don't really need all accessories, a standard mityvac can be bought for around $30.

      "answer": "The short answer is: yes, it does, although in an indirect way, never a direct one. The long answer is: provided that the ambient's air is well above the freezing point of water, that the cabin's air filter is clean and that the system is set to cool ambient air and not recirculated one, the evaporator's thermal load is proportional to fan speed, and, therefore, air volume. If a larger mass of warm air has to pass through it, more energy is transferred, through the evaporator's fins (so that even the evaporator's design and, in particular, its exchange surface play an important part) from the air to the liquid refrigerant allowed inside it by the TEV or orifice tube so it expands more and, along with the absolute pressure inside the evaporator, the refrigerant's vapor superheat (the delta between the boiling point of the fluid at a certain absolute pressure and the temperature of the vapour) increases, since after expanding into saturated vapour, it has enough time to catch enough heat to warm up further by vaporizing the remaining liquid (an important property of a superheated vapour is that no fluid in the liquid state is carried around by the vapour, unlike with saturated vapour). If the system is provided with an OT, well, it's pretty straight from here: a hotter vapour at a higher pressure reaches the compressor, and each piston inside each cylinder, in turn, has to pump that vapour through a small discharge valve on the head's reed plate: that is, the head pressure increases, the opposite force experienced by the piston during its movement increases and this results in more engine load. With a TEV system, the spring inside the TEV allows a certain superheat value to be maintained, and the sensing bulb in contact with the evaporator's outlet raises the valve's needle allowing more liquid refrigerant inside the evaporator when the outlet becomes warm and less when it becomes cold, all of this resulting in a vapour with a certain superheat and pressure at the eva",

      "answer": "As highlighted in the question comments, the culprit was the vibration damper on the crank pulley that had failed, causing the pulley center and outer ring to have some limited slip relative to one another. I'm happy to say that the following symptoms were resolved. With the A/C disengaged, the crank pulley was spinning at a limited speed. This was also causing issues slight engine overheating and reduced power-steering assistance that I did not believe were related at the time of posting the question. With the new crank pulley in, things are much better; no overheating, A/C runs as before and the steering is easier. Engaging the A/C provided additional load on the crank pulley that was enough to cause it the outer ring to stop rotating. This was what caused the 'Check Alternator' message to appear and battery voltage to drop. Belt squeal is vastly reduced, so I probably will still have to replace them.",

      "context": "I have an i-VTEC engine, which Honda claims to be a better and computerized version of their famous VTEC Engine. Now I am wondering: Is it right to tell people that only HONDA has VTEC? or is this technology distributed to other manufacturers as a different name? Honda VTEC is famous for their VTEC's \"Kick in power\", are there similar existing technologies that are originally from other manufacturers?",
      "answer": "The Wikipedia article on VTEC should be good at helping you understand it all. VTEC is a trademark of Honda's patented technology (the original patents have expired but Honda have patented newer implementations such as A-VTEC). So no other manufacturer's production engine can do exactly the same thing. However, that doesn't mean they can't be similar. This explains Honda's VTEC and Nissan's Neo VVL which both use switching/changing cam technology. There are many other methods of variable valve timing, but I couldn't find any other modern production methods like VTEC. So yes, VTEC is Honda only and yes, there are other technologies that achieve the same, or very similar, goals. Additional Resources While not necessary, I found this video to be very intriguing and good at explaining the basic workings of V-TEC. Here's a little something to read as well which compares VTEC to Toyota's VVT-I method.",

After stopping, it then wouldn't start. Symptoms include backfiring, loads of smoke from the right exhaust, and some from behind the air intake when pressing the starter, and immediate stall when the starter is released. The recovery guy made a guess that it could be a failed spark plug (which I hope is all it is) but he didn't have any tools to check (Imperial sizes in a metric country :-( ) so that was a guess.

      "context": "My drive (serpentine) belt was recently chewed down to about half the width and I had to replace it. Which brings the question: if the automotive industry has been gradually replacing timing belts with chains (my Tacoma has a chain and the model just a couple of years older had a belt), why not use a chain also for accessory driving purposes and replace pulleys with sprockets on the alternator, AC pump etc.?",
      "answer": "Here are a few factors besides the ones already mentioned that don't work in the favor of chains: chains need lubrication. Do we really want another grease/oil in the engine bay? pulleys would have to be replaced with sprockets. If some debris finds its way in the engine bay and lodges itself in a sprocket you can look forward to broken teeth in case something goes awry chains are not as flexible as belts. Wrapping one around 5/8 of a sprocket is going to be difficult, so the packaging of the engine auxiliaries will be less compact giving chains tension ain't easy. The chain tensioners I am familiar with rely on hydraulic pressure to keep the timing chain ship-shape chains will have a lot more rotational inertia compared to belts. That is undesirable steel belts (or Kevlar equivalents) are a more suitable alternative to serpentine chains",

      "question": "What is blow-by?",
      "context": "There's a term called blow-by. What is blow-by? What causes it to occur? How does it affect your engine? How do you cure it?",
      "answer": "What is blow-by? Blow-by occurs when the explosion that occurs in your engine's combustion chamber causes fuel, air and moisture to be forced past the rings into the crankcase. Your engine's rings must maintain an excellent fit in order to contain the pressure. What causes it to occur? As rings and cylinder liners wear away they are less capable of maintaining this seal. Consequently as a car ages the amount of blow-by that occurs can increase. Soot and deposits left over from incomplete combustion that collect on the rings can also inhibit their seal worsening blow-by. How does it affect your engine? Blow-by inhibits performance because it results in a loss of compression. When the expanding gases slip past the rings they cannot as effectively push the piston down and make the vehicle go. As a result the car will have less horsepower. This also results in a loss of fuel economy. When the fuel, air and moisture slip into the crankcase they contaminate and dilute the oil in the crankcase. Among the many gasses in your compression chamber are unburned fuel, moisture, sulfur dioxide and soot. Once these gasses slip into your crankcase they can dilute into your engine causing great damage. How do you cure it? Frequent changing of the oil (which removes the carbon solids that erode the metal), adding detergents to the fuel and oil (that dissolve the solids into liquid form), using high quality oil and fuel, and ensuring that the combustion occurs correctly (which prevents the creation of hydrocarbon combustion by-product solids that wear the metal parts). Generally once you have the problem, it's too late. You'd be looking at cleaning/replacing piston rings and cleaning/resurfacing the cylinder walls. https://www.bobistheoilguy.com/blowby.html",

      "context": "I recently acquired a chevy 350 manufactured in 2015 for free because of some crank issues. I'm in the process of rebuilding it and have finished the disassembly of the engine. The engine itself only has 200 miles on it would it be necessary to replace the piston rings on the piston heads or can I leave the ones in there? Would that cause any loss of compression?",
      "answer": "With only 200 miles on the engine, I'm thinking you could get away with using the same rings on the engine as long as you didn't see any scoring on the cylinder walls or any other obvious damage. With that said, a stock set of piston rings is dirt cheap for a 350 or a SBC in general ... as long as you are talking about the Gen I SBC and not a Gen III SBC (LS1)(I know, those aren't exactly 350ci (only 346ci), but yah, throwing it out there). You can get an entire rebuild set, to include bearings, rings, and gaskets for under $100 from Summit (at least at the time of this post). With only 200 miles on the block, I'd bet you wouldn't even have to bust the glaze on the cylinder walls as it should probably still have a great hone. You have to buy the gasket set anyway and everything is all opened up to you already, it really doesn't make sense not to put all fresh parts in there.

      "context": "As winter comes along, I've always thought that revving the car would make it warm up faster, so the heating works better to clear the icy/steamed up windows. Does revving my car at idle to about 2-3k when cold (less than 5C outside) make it warm up faster? Does revving higher (like to 4k max) when driving, and driving in a lower gear than usual make it warm up faster? Obviously going to the redline when cold is stupid. Are there any caveats to doing this? Note: I meant also to use it for defrosting the car when it is covered in ice, as you can't really drive when you can't see! ;)",
      "answer": "The short answer: Yes, you can rev your engine to make it warm up faster. One big caveat to that answer is that it is highly recommended you don't do that. With modern gasoline vehicles, most manufacturers recommend you start the car and immediately start driving. The reasons for this are many, but a couple of the major points: The car will warm up faster by driving it than letting it sit in your driveway for several minutes. Most of the moving parts outside the engine will not be warmed up by idling it in the driveway before you drive, they can only warm up by driving. Your car will be putting off a lot of pollutants for no reason as it just sits there warming up. It's a waste of fuel for little to no benefit except your comfort. This myth is a carry over from the days of carburetors, which did need some warming up before driving. My recommendation: Put on a jacket or coat and just start your car and gently drive away; it'll warm up in a few minutes. If it's extremely cold out, let it run for maybe 30 seconds before driving. Don't push it too hard until it has warmed up. If you sit there revving the engine to warm it up faster, you might as well be driving because you are going to be putting extra wear and tear on the vehicle by revving it too high while cold.",

      "context": "I have a 1997 Caravan (base model) and normally on my drive to work and my highway drives in rush-hour, the engine warms up just fine. I took a road trip for work, about an hour and fifteen minutes of driving at basically 60-80mph the whole way. The engine never warmed up. In fact it went from being warmed up (about halfway up the gauge) to just barely above the Cold marker. My blower only works on high, (a problem for another day) so turning on the heat for that chilly drive made the problem even worse (lost like a bar and a half of engine temp for running the heater at 75% temp, full blower, for maybe 10-15 minutes.) I turned off the heat for the last 30-45 minutes of the drive and it still never returned to normal temperature. It's the Mitsubishi 3.0L V6, which I believe is a cast-iron block, if that helps. It's also a 3-spd, so the engine works pretty hard to maintain highway speeds above 60, it should be producing plenty of heat. What's the best way to go about solving this proble",
      "answer": "It sounds like the engine thermostat has failed in an open state. The thermostat regulates the flow of coolant between the radiator and the engine. When the engine needs more heat, it closes and cuts-off flow through the radiator. When the engine needs less heat, it opens and allows flow to the radiator. With the thermostat stuck open, the flow through the radiator is constant and so your engine will have a hard time keeping it's heat. This sort of problem can happen anytime, but it's not until the weather starts cooling that it gets noticed. Colder outside air means more cooling from the radiator. As your your other question, \"could any serious damage have been done with the engine below operating temp at highway speeds...\" The answer is probably not. You may have lost some fuel economy, but cooling an engine too much shouldn't be too much of a problem. The other extreme, having too much heat, is where engines start to have big problems. In either case, a replacement thermostat is typically very cheap, usually < $25. Changing it depends on how easy it is to get to and how comfortable you are with draining some radiator fluid and refilling it.",

I know there are a few components for cars that have \"cam\" in the name, like \"camshaft\", \"cam belt\", \"cam sensor\", \"reversing camera\" etc. What exactly do they mean by \"performance cams\" and how do they increase power output from the engine?",
      "answer": "A cam... in its most generic sense converts rotary motion into linear motion or vice versa using solid egg-shaped actuators (lobes)¹. An engine camshaft... refers to the shaft which houses a series of cams that actuate the opening/closing of the intake and exhaust valves on a four-stroke engine. A performance camshaft... is just a camshaft whose lobe profile is tailored to utilize more of an engine's potential. Here is a visual comparison²: The performance improvement can come from two types of change: altered valve lift usually a higher lift on the lobe, which increases in length of the valve stroke, which allows for more air to enter through the inlet valves, increasing the power potential of the engine. altered valve timing - essentially modify when the valves open and close, which has an impact on the effective compression ratio, power output, emissions and other things. Here is a neat diagram summarizing lots of camshaft-related terminology³: Performance camshafts don't guarantee performance For several possible reasons. : the existing camshaft is well-optimized something else is limiting the engine's potential ECU maps are not taking advantage of the hardware change The key thing to remember here is that engine power isn't totally reliant on a single component in most situations. It's usually all about how the different component play in harmony with one another. References ¹ - Wikimedia, ² - bestservis.com, ³ - rbracing-rsr.com",

The car is a 2006 Chrysler 300C, which occasionally dies at low RPM (e.g. at a stop sign). I can feel the RPM drop suddenly and see it on the tach; if they dip too low the engine dies. If I notice it fast enough I can rev the engine to keep it going. Sometimes the engine RPM will stutter while driving as well, but the engine will typically recover if the RPMs are high enough when it happens. The problem only occurs shortly after filling up with gas and seems to be more likely the lower the tank was at fill-up, but I don't have much data on that.

These reports very accurately describe what we noticed. Update: The dealership said that the purge valve solenoid and vapor canister were contaminated with fuel. That's what they said that was wrong, and we got those parts fixed (several hundred $ IIRC). Unfortunately, the problem resurfaced. By that time we'd moved, so we took the car to a totally different dealership. They also could not reproduce the problem reliably and there was no code on the computer. They called around to a dozen or so other dealerships and ultimately came to the conclusion that the Hemi engines just do not idle well and some of them have a tendency to just shut off. I don't have corroboration or evidence on this next bit, which is just my speculation, but I suspect that there is just a stack up of various tolerances and timings in the system and gains set in the automatic idle throttle controller in the car's computer that for some engines under some conditions stack up in a way that causes the engine to shut off unpredictably. Update 2: They said there was nothing they could really do to fix it.

      "question": "Crank vs turn over vs start vs whatever",
      "context": "I see conversations like the following a lot: A: My car won't start. B: Does it crank? A: Yes but it won't turn over. B: Wait, I'm confused. So, it tries? A: Well it makes a sound. B: Like whir whir whir or just the clicks? A: Yes. B: AHHHHHHH! What terms and phrases are generally used in the context of observations made of a car starting (or attempting to) and what's the difference between them? I can think of: The clicking sound (not sure what that's called). Crank Turn over (I think that means the same thing as crank? Or is it referring to the moment it moves beyond the attempts and actually starts? Car won't crank, turn over, or start is a good example of a question title where confusion may be present.) Start Maybe other things (like here somebody used the word \"catch\"). There seems to be a further bit of confusion regarding how far it gets when trying to start, which I can't really describe accurately since I don't know the words, but the progression seems to be: No clicks at all",
      "answer": "I'd say the following, which seem fairly universal: Nothing - the worst option, you turn the key and nothing happens at all - either the battery is flat, the immobiliser is misbehaving, or the starter solenoid isn't getting any signal/power. Clicking - the starter is engaging, or trying to, but it's not turning the engine. It might be that it's failing to engage, or there isn't any power getting to the starter itself. Clicking and whining - the starter is engaging, but can't turn the engine. Either not enough power to turn it over of (worst!) the engine has siezed... Whirring (with or without clicking) - the starter it turning, but isn't engaged - most likely the solenoid has failed Slow Cranking - the starter is trying to turn the engine, but not fast enough to fire - usually down to a poor battery Fast Cranking - the engine is turning over quickly, but won't fire. It will be missing Spark, Fuel or compression on one or more cylinders... Very Fast Cranking - another really bad one, this means there is a serious lack of compression! Trying to fire / Coughing - the engine turns over fine, and 'coughs' as it tries to fire, but won't keep going - Usually either a problem with ECU/spark, or not enough fuel getting through Starting, but quickly cutting out - usually the same causes as coughing Running - Happy engine!",

It could come down to whether they want a turbocharger in front of the engine where it's easier to get to and where there might be more space. It could be that the design of a transmission limits space to one side or the other.

      "context": "I have a KTM Duke 390 - 2013, single cylinder 373 cc motorcycle for 4 months now. I bought it from another owner when it was around 9500 km. now It's at 12000. This is my first bike, and I'm trying to improve my abilities, technical and theoretical knowledge about the bikes too. For the last month-when winter got really harsh here-my bike started to behave differently. Especially in the mornings I start the engine, and immediately start riding without warming it up. And at the first stop at a traffic light no matter I'm on neutral, or pulled the clutch lever fully while on first gear the engine stops, and won't start for 10 to 15 minutes(bump-start works). Very very annoying behavior. In order to avoid this, I don't let the engine to run idle(always give some gas up to 2500/13000 rpm - its idle is 1500 rpm). Interesting point is when I took it to KTM service they said: \"This is a normal behavior of single cylinder engines. You have to start it on neutral, warm it up at least 4-5 minute",
      "answer": "Pretty Common Problem with the Duke 390 This is a very common issue with the KTM 390. There are dozens of posts regarding customers who are experiencing the same exact issue. Additionally, there are a few YouTube video's that show the problem happening pretty consistently. The various proposed issues related by customers seem to revolve around these theories in particular. The bike comes with ECU programming that is too lean. This is an innate issue with single cylinder larger bore motorcycles and can't be fixed. A loose connector to the ECU A dirty throttle body A dirty fuel injector Faulty ECU Inadequate fuel pump pressure, faulty fuel pump Faulty side stand switch Faulty tip switch (kills engine when bike falls on it's side) Here is a list of URL's from OP's on various forums. YouTube video showing the issue with a cold engine Unresolved stall issue on a KTM 390 forum Forum post where OP has the issue with a brand new vehicle A bunch of people saying 'me too' Additionally, there are plenty of reviews from motorcycle magazines where they complain of the same exact issue. Apparent Fix There is a claim that the true fix is an ECU update. The justification was that the ECU had a map that was too lean. Here is one post. Confirmation I also called a friend that works at a local KTM shop. He indicated that there is awareness to the issue and that there is a service bulletin from KTM to update the ECU as well as set the idle 100 RPM's higher. If it's under warranty the dealership should be aware of this and be able to resolve it without an issue. please note that I called a US dealership, KTM is notorious for not releasing service bullets internationally Additional Thoughts I have seen this type of issues with dozens of bikes including my own. Most common fix was the ventilation hose being bound up and incorrectly routed so that when the tank was sat on the bike, the hose pinched. After riding for a few miles a negative pressure would buildup in the tank and the fuel pum",

      "question": "What exactly is a head gasket?",
      "context": "From what I have gathered, a \"head gasket\" is an important part of the engine on most cars, but that is about it. What is a head gasket? Where is a head gasket? Why is it necessary?",
      "answer": "A head gasket is a piece of material which is located between the head and the block inside an engine. It is usually made of a material which is softer than the head and block to allow for sealing of imperfections between the two mating surfaces. It also seals ports which transfer oil or coolant between the two parts. Here is a picture of a typical head gasket: The head gasket has several jobs to perform: Seals the combustion chamber Keeps the oil in the oil and the water in the water, and both out of the combustion chamber Allows for movement of the head/block surfaces to ensure proper sealing while the engine is running. This is really important if the engine block is made of one material (iron) and the head is made of another (aluminum), as the two metals expand and contract at different rates during the heating/cooling cycles. As stated, the head gasket can be made of many different materials. There are several different types: Multi-Layer Steel (MLS) - As the name implies, it's made of multiple layers of steel. Since the layers are thin, they will deform under the tight load of head as it's clamped to the block. Pure Copper - Usually has a ring embedded within it at the cylinders to enclose the cylinder pressures. Composite - Older tech. Usually made of graphite and/or asbestos. Elastomeric – utilized a steel core plate with molded in place silicone rubber beads to seal oil and coolant passages. The bores were sealed by rolled steel fire rings in a more conventional manner.",

      "question": "Follow up question on spark plug heat range",
      "context": "@vini_i gave a great answer to my previous question here (What is spark plug heat range) Part of that answer is that the reason for spark plugs having different heat ranges is that if it runs to hot you can get pre-ignition, and too cold you get deposits on the plug which are supposed to burn off. So thinking about it, some other questions came up: What symptoms would you see (just driving the car) if you are running to cold a plug? What would the spark plugs look like if you are getting either pre-ignition or deposits? What does a plug running in the butter zone look like for a car engine, and also for a small two stroke engine like a snow blower or lawn mower? Different engines require plugs in different heat ranges. What characteristics of those engines create the need for the different ranges? Thanks in advance for any info!",
      "answer": "If working on a stock vehicle or small engine just replace the plug with what it calls for. Someone has already done all the testing and research for you for the correct plugs. Your not going to strap a super charger to your lawn mower or string trimmer. You should only think about changing away from the standard plugs if your car is modified. Also you should mess with the heat range only after the fuel mixture has been figured out. This is because a fuel mixture that is off will make it look like there is a heat range problem. Very simply if a plug is too cold it will foul. It will look black with soot. You will notice hard starting or misfires under load. A plug that is fouled from too rich of a mixture will look very similar to a plug that is too cold. A plug that is too hot will look white, very white. In very sever cases the preignition will actually damage the plug, melt the center or side electrode, or even shatter the porcelain. The simptoms will sound like ignition knock or pining, what every you want too call it. If the fuel mixture is too lean the plug will also look white because a lean mixture burns hotter. If the heat range is just right the the plug will look mat or tan in color. The head design is the biggest factor in what the heat range of the plug will be. The thermal design of the head will dictate how quickly it can wick away that pesky heat. For example if two engines are exactly the same with one having a cast iron head and the other with an aluminum head, the aluminum head will need a hotter plug. Aluminum conduct heat faster than cast iron. The coolant flow through the head can also affect the heat range. A head with better flow requires hotter plugs.",

So if you have the lights on, it lights up like the top half of the taillight (a normal 5W bulb) but when you press the brakes, it also lights up the other filament (maybe both at the same time? I'm not sure) My question is, since it's connected like a normal light bulb, how does it know which filament to light up? Does it depend on how much power is provided?",
      "answer": "A typical 1157 taillight bulb looks like this: The filaments have a common connected to the shell and the other end of each goes to each the two terminals on the bottom of the bulb. The bayonet pins are offset so the bulb can only be inserted one way. In the case of the 1157 bulb, the elements are 26.8W/8.3W, and have about a 10:1 difference in lumens (and about 1/4 the lifetime for the brighter brake light filament).",

      "answer": "I think the chain of events went something like this: Overload or short caused a fuse to blow. The root problem wasn't addressed and after replacing the fuse, it blew again, and again… Somebody got tired of replacing fuses and \"upgraded\" to a larger fuse. The larger fuse \"solved\" the problem (and helped to diagnose it as an overload, rather than a short – or at least not a \"hard\" short to ground). Over time the wires overheated enough that the insulation started to melt. It sounds like the problem still exists as fuses are still blowing. Noticing that the fuse is the wrong size and going back to they correct fuse will stop the overheating – and will make the problem of blowing the fuse worse. If you are lucky the insulation has been damaged, but not so badly that there are new shorts in the damaged stretch of the harness. Once you identify the oversized fuses, look it up in the owner's manual or service manual to see what devices the circuit(s) serve.

It was very tight going in and now I can't get it out. I'm concerned (but not convinced) that the plastic may have melted fusing the connector to the resistor.

      "question": "Will an auxiliary battery hurt a vehicle&#39;s alternator?",
      "context": "I am going to be road tripping and living out of my SUV for a while. I need a way to power a tiny portable cooler/fridge 24/7 and would like to be able to power my cell phone, laptop, and maybe a few other things when the vehicle is off. I have been looking into the possibility of mounting a solar panel on the roof and using that to charge a deep cycle battery, but it would expensive and complicated. Using the alternator to charge the auxiliary battery would be so much simpler. I know I would need to use a battery isolator. Here's a video example of how it works My question is whether this could damage the alternator in any way? Will it wear it out faster, or is it just using energy that would otherwise be wasted?",
      "answer": "So I thought I'd come here to explain some physics. There are two important equations: p=iv - power (watts) = amps * volts v=ir - volts = amps * resistance Note - an amp is a measure of how many electrons are flowing through the wire per second. 1 amp is A LOT of them - I forget the exact number (I'm a mathematician, not a physicist) A volt is how much energy each electron has. A generator is only able to provide so much energy to each electron (12 volts = 12 joules per coloumb (a coloumb is a large quantity of electrons)) but the amount of them it moves along can vary, that's your amps. watts is a rate of energy, it's in joules per second. So 5 watts for 10 seconds is 50 joules of energy. Your fuel tank could be measured in joules of energy it holds and your engine is the magical device that turns fuel into mechanical energy. As you know cars run pretty much exclusively on 12 volts - or some other fixed number. This means if you want, say 600 watts, your alternator needs to be able to provide \"i\" in 600=12i, which is 300=6i, 100=3i, i=33.3 amps, which is A LOT of current. This is why wires melt more often in cars then they do at home. Where to provide 600 watts at 220 volts would be about 2.73 amps. Over 10 times less electrons carrying charge per second through devices! So the more power you draw the more electrons the alternator has to drag through your wiring, the more energy it takes from the engine. A good \"back of the envelope\" value for how much energy an engine produces (mechanical of course, not heat) is 2,400 watts. If you draw 600 you've only got 1800 watts left, so you put your foot down harder (thus using more fuel) to get back up to 2,400 watts for kinetic energy. Okay so that's the first half. Batteries Car batteries are NOT BUILT FOR CONSTANT DRAINS they are good at one thing, and one thing only: short bursts of high drain (like a starter motor) Also they can retain charge for a long time. But I wont contrast with Lithium based batteries here If I r",

There is a flange on it with a 5.2mm hole but the relay specification does not state what screw should be used. The fact that the relay can be placed in a number of positions makes me suspect that there is a standard type of mounting bracket and screw in a car.

      "answer": "This type of addon relay is intended to be mounted to any convenient existing bolt that you have available. As there is no standard for what size bolts to be used in an engine bay or around the body, there is no standard size recommendation for mounting this relay. What you will do is find an existing bracket or mount in the engine bay, then back the bolt out and stack this relay against the bracket, putting the bolt back through. You can often find a spot on the sides of the strut tower that will accommodate. One thing to keep in mind about these relays, is they are can be sensitive to water and excessive heat. Avoid mounting in \"splash areas\" and near the exhaust manifolds to prevent premature wear to the relay. ==== BONUS ==== To make the install a little nicer you can use one of these relay sockets instead of spade terminals. Slip a piece of heat shrink tubing over the end of your wire and over the end of the relay socket's wire, connect the two wires with a crimp on butt splice, then slide the heat shrink tubing over the end of the splice and heat the tubing to seal it all up.",

Alternator works fine, relay is fine, cable management should be fixed for the fuel pump, but that's just for a better future use. The problem was: Somehow the fuel tank was extremely dirty, fuel pump engine died completely and the whole left part of fuel pump assembly was dirty, fuel pump filter was almost totally black from that dirt. Now I think to go back to the garage where they previously cleaned my fuel tank, to do it in",
      "answer": "Dirt in the tank could definitely be the cause of the burned pin because the burned pin suggests that the pump was drawing a larger than normal current from that wire. The pump having to contend with dirt in the tank could mean it was having to work significantly harder than when pumping clean fuel which would be a very good reason for it to draw excessive amounts of electrical current. This additional current manifest in a significantly hotter temperature in the wiring and connectors and would explain the visual charring on the connector.",

      "question": "What Could Cause Flash Over / Arcing to Reappear on New Plugs?",
      "context": "I had been having some hesitation problems on my 98 Mazda 626 which after a great deal of research seemed to be solved by replacing the plugs: As you can see, there seems to be signs of flash over / arcing on the number one cylinder spark plug. After a while the problem seemed to come back, and I couldn't understand why. Then while I was doing my front oil seal, timing belt and water pump I had to pull the replacement plugs: As can be seen, there seems to be arcing on the number one cylinder spark plug again! ( in addition to what looks like carbon fouling on the number 1 & 4 plugs, but that's a separate issue ) Any ideas what the heck might be going on? EDIT Nov. 13th 2016 So @FredWilson was right about the boot having a carbon trail in it: However I couldn't see anything like that in the #4 plug boot. I think I'll try the dielectric grease by itself first just for fun to see what happens. POSTSCRIPT Nov. 28th 2016 So I pulled out all the plugs, and cleaned the porcelain sections and ",
      "answer": "I think your problem is your plug wires. I think they are leaking along the boot and down to ground (earth). With this loss of energy, you'll also see the large carbon buildup on the business end, due to unburnt fuel deposits. Since you are saying you are seeing the carbon tracking on the number one plug again, this is my reasoning for telling you the plug wires. Since they haven't been changed, this is the most likely culprit. Also, whenever you put new plugs or wires on, use dielectric grease. Squirt a little into the boot just before you put it onto the spark plug. This will do two things for you. First, it will keep electrical leaks like this to a minimum. Dielectric grease doesn't transmit electricity, so it becomes an insulator. Secondly, it will also keep the boot from adhering to the porcelain of the spark plug. If you ever need to take the boot off the plug for any reason, it will come off a lot easier.",

      "answer": "I am not sure of your exact solution, but Brian Blum of Texas Instruments says the amperage draw depends on what state the device is in, of which there are seven states. According to the document in the link, it draws as follows: State 1 (wake-up) - 6.1mA State 2 (pre-processing) - 8.1 mA State 3 (pre-RX) - 12.3 mA State 4 (RX) - 22.3 mA State 5 (Rx-to-Tx) - 11.1 mA State 6 (Tx) - 29.3 mA State 7 (Post processing) - 8.1 mA These are for the device listed in the document, but should be about the same. As you can see, these are very small amounts of draw. I would also bet, if you look at your device specs, when the vehicle is off, your device is off: no power consumption during this time. For your edification, it takes 1000 mA to make one (1) Amp.",

      "question": "Does idle RPM increase when there is heavy load on the electrical system?",
      "context": "I am thinking about installing a 500w halogen (HDX brand) on the roll bar in my jeep as the dome light because often I work in the back when it is dark or when I would like more light. The 500w light will be drawing about 40amps from my car's electrical system (battery or alternator). Currently I have an 800w inverter that I can just plug it into. If I am using the light while my jeep is idle the alternator will be producing more power to power the 500w light, right? Will the engine RPM automatically rise so the alternator can output more power?",
      "answer": "I don't know of any vehicle (as equipped from the factory) that increases the idle speed to compensate for a large draw on the battery. If the alternator starts bogging the engine down then the computer should compensate to maintain the set idle speed but not make it increase. It's easy to find out if the alternator will put out enough current at idle to run the light. With the light turned on and the engine at idle check the voltage at the battery. If the voltage is 12.6 or higher then alternator is putting out enough current to run the electrical loads. If the voltage falls below 12.6 volts the alternator is not putting out enough current to run the electrical loads. If your alternator doesn't put out enough at idle you have a couple of options install a high idle device to raise the RPM. Install a larger amp alternator, there may be a larger one available from your parts store or you can have your alternator rebuilt to a higher amp version. Some other options to consider: Hard wire the inverter and put an outlet that's easy to access from the bed of the truck. Then you could just clamp the light on the roll bar (or wherever) and plug it in whenever you wanted to used it. This would eliminate any issues with vibration causing the light to prematurely fail. With the price of fuel and the unnecessary wear on the engine you could consider a small generator. Honda makes a small quiet 1000 watt generator that would work great for this application. Some of them have a Halogen flood light attached already. As already suggested you could use a 12 volt light to get the same effect. LED lights are expensive but they will have a lower amp draw for the same amount of light.",

      "question": "What could have caused 1 brake pad to wear down to metal while my other 3 pads are ~50% used?",
      "context": "I just paid $400 to replace the front brake pads and rotors on a 2011 Honda Pilot. Here is what the 4 brake pads look like: 3 are in great shape--maybe 50% usage?--and 1 is down to the metal, and I had metal-on metal contact to my rotor. The metal-on-metal pad was on the inside of the rotor--I think on the passenger side. Here are the 4 pads: A closeup of the metal-on-metal one: 2 good pads: The 4 pads stacked together: the bare one is the 3rd one down, with no pad surface left: Regular used rotor surface: And the rotor rubbing metal-on-metal on the bad pad (for only 1 or 2 days): What would cause only 1 brake pad to do this? All I can think is that maybe the last time I paid to have my brake pads replaced, the shop literally just forgot to replace one of the 4 pads, and so it started out already half-used. See also: Replaced brake pads - one pad was full, the other was gone. Brakes now very hot after driving Note: I compressed all images above to the required < 2 MB each by using jpeg",
      "answer": "It's must likely down to siezed slide pins, if it's a sliding caliper setup (more likely), or a siezed piston if it's a dual piston caliper. If it's the slide pins, it's a fairly easy fix - extract the pins (which can be more or less difficult depending on how stuck they are!), clean them up, clean up the holes they slide in, re-grease and reassemble with new gaiters (the little rubber boots that stop dirt getting in - chances are these will have split, which is a common cause of this problem). Last time I did this, at the same time as doing the pads, it only added half an hour or so to the time taken. A stuck caliper can also be freed off, but is liable to stick again, so in that case it might be better to have them replaced or refurbished. Did you ask the mechanic who changed them about it? They'd have had to do something to free it, otherwise they wouldn't have been able to fit the new pads in! If they didn't sort it properly, get it fixed ASAP, as not only will the replacement be sticking too, and so wearing out, but your brakes will be dragging on that side as well.",

      "context": "I managed to turn a routine brake job into a bit of a minor nightmare by having one of the calliper bracket bolts break off. One bit is stuck inside the calliper bracket. I don't know exactly why it happened -- I think because the lack of space my socket was not on perfectly straight -- but it did and I'll have to deal with it. After a lot of swearing, I calmed down a little and realised there were two things I need to do: Remove the broken screw from the calliper bracket Find a replacement bolt I have a screw extractor kit and I've used it before successfully; I just hope it'll work on a screw as stuck as this one. I haven't tried it yet, since it's nighttime here and I'm not allowed to make much noise. Finding the replacement bolt, ironically, seems to be the harder problem. While I know which part I need (M10x26.5), I can't seem to find the exact replacement bolt in my country. I could order from Amazon or ebay, but it will take at least two weeks to get to me -- and I don't want to",
      "answer": "First of all some nitpicking: M10x26.5 isn't the correct designation: You need also the thread width. Car manufacturers are very eager to use some unusual fine threads. My personal strategy would be the following: Screw out the second bolt and go to an industrial supply shop, do not go to the DIY shops. Show them the bolt, ask for a second one and tell them that it is used to keep your brakes attached to your car. Should the shop not be stocked of this bolt they perhaps can order it or give you at least an indication on where to find it. A good indication would be the \"Würth\" chain, although you probably need to buy an entire box. Make sure you get a bolt of the same width, length, thread width and most important: the same grade (visible by a stamp on the head of the bolt). It is ok if your new bolt comes without thread-locking micro-encapsulation, just make sure you use some thread-locking compound on installing. Some background information: Most of the time they use an 10.9 grade bolt for safety critical uses. 12.9 is used in exceptional cases (when the engineer messed up and they need to improve the strength of the fastener?). 8.8 grade is standard industry stuff and everything under 8.8 is some rubbish stuff they peddle in those DIY-shops. Edit: The comment from @alephzero is a better answer than mine: The bmw dealer ought to have that bolt",

Also I have just noticed last night that one of the brakes is grinding onto my rotor(kinda feels that way), and that it makes this very bad low grinding noise. What seems to be the problem for this? I want to be at least informed before I bring this to the mechanic as I need to be at least prepared(financially) before I bring it there, or otherwise it might get stuck at the garage for a long time.

Only pads have been replaced in the brake components.",
      "answer": "You stated that \"Only pads have been replaced in the brake components.\" If the rotors were not turned (machined) or replaced at the same time, this could be a problem. The surface of the rotor needs to be fresh, or the brakes will not work up to expectations. Also, consideration must be given to the proper \"bedding\" of the brakes. If they were not bedded properly, any one of the four pads could be worn down to nothing already causing the noise/issue you are talking about. (For proper bedding technique, read this thread ... pay attention to the links). Not bedding the brakes correctly can cause premature wear of the brake pads, or even pulsing which may feel like a warped rotor. Another thing to check is to see if a dust shield hasn't been bent for some reason and is now rubbing on the rotor. In this case, it could sound an awful lot like the \"squealer\" sounds when it starts rubbing. Something else to contemplate is you might have a bad wheel bearing, which could cause the hub to lean over slightly, causing issues like you are describing. This could happen, but is really an outside possibility.",

As the snow builds up and you encounter low friction driving conditions due to snow and ice the ABS will kick in more frequently because you are encountering low friction conditions. The 'grinding' you hear and feel in your peddle is by design. You have nothing to worry about.",

So, when the brake is activated and the piston moves towards the disk, the gasket deforms a little to allow this movement without sliding.

One of the pads would not fit in the allocated space in the caliper frame. The mounting hardware was seated properly (removed the rust that had formed), there was nothing else in the way, but the pad was just too long for the space in the caliper mounting frame. So, I ground off what was probably one thousandth of an inch, maybe two thousanths, bottom line, very, very little material came off. Just enough to take a tiny bit off, try the fit, repeat till it seated in the frame. Couple of questions: Is this the correct procedure when this happens? If it is, should I have painted the now bare metal \"ear\" to prevent it from rusting? (I did use a high temperature silicone lubricant to keep it moving against the new stainless mounting hardware) Is there anything else I should have done to the ground down \"ear\" to insure a long serivce life? Note: The car was a 2004 Kia Optim",
      "answer": "This is acceptable practice. Low quality brake pad backing plate edges can be very rough and the dimensions are often off spec. Higher quality pads usually have a better formed edge that fits correctly. As long as there are not rust flakes causing \"rust jacking\" under the pad end shims and the end shims are in good shape it is OK to file off the high spots on the pad tabs. The pads must move freely in the channels but not have enough end play that they create a click sound on braking.",

      "answer": "Getting them to break loose is the biggest challenge. I use a good penetrate, soak them several times over 3-4 days, use high quality brake line wrenches to turn the nuts to prevent rounding the brake line nuts, as they are soft steel. Cheap brake line wrenches will round the nuts, buy good quality wrenches of the proper size, metric or american. Use a wrench on the other side to help hold the line from twisting when using the brake line wrench on the nut side. If the nut does not turn before they round, you will have to use a propane or oxy-acetelene torch to heat the nut very hot, let it cool and heat it again, do this several times to heat cycle the nut then re soak with penetrate in between cylces, then it should turn without rounding the nut. Heat may damage the flex line but may be the only way to break the nut loose, in this case replace the flex line, a casualty of war. Once the old line is off determine which flare type you have, nut type and line diameter. Once you remove it you will have to buy some steel (not copper) brake line of proper diameter and cut to length with a steel tubing cutter, then slide the new nuts on first, then do a proper flare on both ends of the line, you will need to buy a brake line flaring tool, follow the instructions that come with the tool carefully. Steel brake line is fairly flexible but will kink if not careful when bending, Parts stores here in the usa sell variable lengths of different diameter brake lines that are pre-flared with nuts included, just cut the length you need and reuse the nuts and re-flare as needed. You need to determine the diameter of the old line and type of flare nut needed. Sometimes the pre flared lengths have the correct nuts, sometimes they don't, nuts may have different thread pitches-diameters for the same line size, if you do not damage the old nuts they can be re-used. There are two types of brake flares, inverted double flare (most common) and bubble flare. To do a bubble flare you use the do",

      "question": "What actually happens when there is no brake fluid in the brake fluid reservoir?",
      "context": "I was curious, given that fact that a lack of engine oil can completely destroy your engine, can a lack of brake fluid completely destroy your brakes? I can imagine how that could be even worst than a broken engine for safety reasons. *What exactly are all of the disadvantages to running an engine when the brake fluid becomes too low?",
      "answer": "Not having brake fluid in your car won't destroy the brakes, but whatever you hit when the brakes don't work just might. :) The brakes in basically every passenger car since the 50's are hydraulically operated. That means when you press the brake pedal you are pressurizing some fluid lines. Those lines run out to the wheels where the added pressure forces the pads against the rotors or drums. If that fluid is low or missing you will end up with nothing but air in those lines. Air is very compressible, which means when you squeeze it it's volume decreases. The brake fluid in your car is for all intents and purposes incompressible. That means when your foot on the brake pedal operates the master cylinder which squeezes the fluid into the lines that force is transmitted almost completely to operating the brakes. When there is air in the line all you do is move the air around a little and you apply very little force into operating the brakes. When you have only a little air in the lines the pedal just feels \"spongy\" because you compress the bubbles down to nothing and then you are closing the brakes. When there is a lot of air, or no fluid at all, you just don't operate the brakes at all, and you have a very bad day.. The good news is that topping off the fluid with the right type (DOT-3, DOT-4, and a collection of others are used depending on what car you own) and then bleeding the brakes will bring them right back again. That assumes that when they were dry you didn't end up with any kind of debris in the lines. With no brakes you likely didn't drive it much though.. lol Bleeding the brakes just means opening those hydraulic lines at one wheel at a time and pumping the brakes. That forces the fluid and air through the line and out the tube that's open. Eventually you end up with nothing but fluid and can close that line off and do the same for the others. There's a bit more to it, but that's the simplified version. Bottom line, unlike your engine where the fluid is a ",

(The parking brake uses the discs, so there is no additional drum or similar.) When resetting the pistons, they also have to be rotated (clockwise in my case). This system is quite common for many car models, but I would like to know how this works internally, so can anyone describe it or has some good references?",
      "answer": "The operation is simpler then you might think. In broad strokes there is a screw type setup in the center of the piston. One part of the screw is loosely attached to the piston, the other part is attached to the lever. When the breaks are applied using hydraulics the piston has some degree of freedom to move beyond the length of the screw setup. If the piston moves farther then the screw will allow the screw will rotate slightly to accommodate, this happens as the pads wear. To bring it all around, when the lever on the back is pulled it rotates the screw extending it. That extension pushes out on the piston activating the breaks.",

      "context": "I was watching a car review on YouTube recently. I know that carbon ceramic brakes are often a huge optional extra on cars and they're normally physically huge as well (from what I can tell). What is the difference between standard and carbon ceramic brakes?",
      "answer": "The huge size is not limited to carbon ceramic, that's just an attribute of most high performance cars' rotors. Carbon ceramic brakes are more expensive because the exotic compound does a much better job of dissipating heat than traditional steel rotors. Because they are able to dissipate heat faster, they do not get \"soft\" as quickly as other brakes. \"Getting soft\" means the brakes perform worse: they do not brake as hard and do not stop the car as quickly. When brakes get \"soft\" they are typically too hot to operate. Brakes work by converting physical energy into heat. In some cases, they can also convert this into light energy, as is often the case with carbon ceramic brakes when they glow red. Although brakes can also get \"soft\" by boiling your brake fluid or getting air in the lines, you will typically see this due to overheated rotors as opposed to brake fluid issues.",

It comes and goes but for the most part it's always there. Can something like that be enforced to be fixed by the manufacturer? The car is under a 4-year warranty. I should also mention that I brake very gradually by nature but I believe that shouldn't be a problem.",
      "answer": "Carbon-metallic Brake Pads If you do have carbon-metallic brake pads, especially high performance ones like you might find on an Audi S4 (although I can't say for sure), the material that they are made out of do tend to be prone to noise which is an artifact that occurs from the manufacturer trying to optimise for braking efficiency. How to Fix Brake Noise Here is a quote from a website that you may find useful: If the noise pops up just before your vehicle comes to a complete stop, as opposed to squealing throughout the entire range of braking, the cause could be a brake pad that is vibrating against the rotor. A set of brake pad vibration damper pads could cure the squeal, but there's no guarantee. You did say that it comes and goes, but you also said that for the most part its always there so I don't know if new brake pad vibration damper pads are going to fix your particular issue but it is definitely something to consider. Another thing to consider would be to replace your brake pads altogether, which may be expensive and doesn't guarantee that it will fix your issue. Also I suspect that it would void your warranty, which on such a new, heavily depreciating car like yours you probably want to do! Otherwise, the only thing I can suggest is taking it back to the dealer to see what they say. Especially if it is happening all the time, not just when you come to a stop. Note: If you have a rather sporty driving style or you go for a track day, your brake temperatures can get hot. It is normal if the brakes produce noise at this point. Just stop and let them cool down for a while.",

      "question": "Why aren’t drive chains completely taut?",
      "context": "I don’t understand why roller drive chains in motorcycles have some degree of slack (around 1 inch movement) in them? What’s wrong with having a completely taut chain with no slack? Also, does the amount of slack in the chain affect transmission (power delivered) in any way?",
      "answer": "The main reason slack is needed is the rear suspension of the bike. In a \"perfect\" setup, the axis of the rear swing-arm and the final drive of the engine would be one and the same. This is not normally possible so a compromise must be made. In this diagram, you can see the two different axis. Because of this, on a typical street bike, the chain has more tension when you are sitting on the bike and the rear suspension is slightly compressed. A common mistake is to make the chain tight when it's on a stand and then ending up with a chain that is way too tight once you're riding. Chain and suspension geometry is a pretty complex topic. The diagram above is from this site which also has a lot more technical information. https://www.sportrider.com/more-fun-geometry#page-3 Another reason for the slack is the physics problem of why you can never pull a rope across two points to make it perfectly straight. Gravity is going to make the chain sag and appear to have some slack. The amount of force needed to make the chain appear to be tight and slack free would be detrimental to the wheel and final drive bearings. There's no benefit to tightening out all of the slack - only increased wear.",

My car first slid backwards, but as the engine applied power to the wheels, the car slows down its descent and starts climbing up the slope. My loose understanding of a transmission is that the crankshaft is geared down to the driveshaft. However, it seems like it would be impossible for something like this to happen since the wheels have a negative rotation. How is this possible?",
      "answer": "The torque converter picks up the slack In essence, this device connects the engine crankshaft to the transmission's input shaft through a fluid-type coupling. Once the turbine spins fast enough relative to the pump, the pump will start turning as well. Since the turbine and pump are not mechanically coupled the gear ratio between the engine and transmission is not fixed, which explains why your car slides back on an incline initially until sufficient engine speed is reached, at which point the inertia of the fluid inside the torque converter slowly turns the pump and transmission-side shaft to allow the vehicle to change speed and move up the incline.",

While automatic racing gearboxes can beat a driver when it comes to performance, for the type of vehicle you describe, a manual can perform significantly higher than an automatic if the driver knows how to use it. But then if you really wanted high acceleration you would choose a different car. Maintenance is much cheaper on manual gearboxes as they are much less complex, but if the driver doesn't know what they are doing then they can chew up clutches. Fuel economy is close between the two - am automatic can be consistent at saving fuel by short shifting in situations where acceleration is not needed, but again, a good driver can always change at the most appropriate point for what is coming, so can be in the correct great at all times - which can save mileage. TL/DR it depends. If you are experienced with a manual, get a manual.",

      "context": "I have a 2013 Subaru Impreza with a continuously variable transmission with ~40k miles on it. About two months ago I blew out the front right tire and took it to a tire shop. The folks at the tire shop said the tire wasn't repairable and that I had to replace two tires. The put the new tires on the back and moved the undamaged, but worn tires on the front. I can't remember if the worn tires were 60% worn or 40% worn, but they were the stock tires that I bought the car with. About a month ago (and maybe 2k miles after replacing the tires) I started hearing a humming/clicking noise from the car (though no indicator lights went off). I took it to a shop and they told me that the noise was coming from the transmission and that I had to take it to the dealership. The dealer told me that the transmission was shot due to the diameter difference between the worn front tires and the new rear tires. Apparently the front tires are 4/32 thread and the rear are 10/32. The dealer claims that the war",
      "answer": "They likely do hold some liability, since they should have known that an AWD should have matching tire diameters across all tires. They may argue that you hold some responsibility since the Impreza owners manual makes this pretty clear: . You must install four tires that are of the same size, circumference, construction, manufacturer, brand (tread pattern), degree of wear, speed symbol and load index. Mixing tires of different types, sizes or degrees of wear can result in damage to the vehicle’s power train. Use of different types or sizes of tires can also dangerously reduce controllability and braking performance and can lead to an accident. However, it seems to be well known in the tire industry that AWD's need matching tires, and that Subaru's tolerances are particularly tight: http://www.souzastireservice.com/tires-101/tire-matching-awd-4wd.aspx Subarus have, to our knowledge, the tightest tolerance of any AWD system. Since we see so many, we can tell you what the tolerance is. It can be stated in two ways: The first is 2/32nds tread depth across all four tires. The problem with this is that actual tire dimensions can vary from brand to brand and even from model to model. ... You may ask what the big deal is? Well, on the Subarus, if all four tires aren't matched within 1/4\" around the circumference, you will break the transmission, not maybe or sometimes - it definitely happens. Here's a tire shop that took responsibility for installing mismatched tires and replaced a customer's differential: http://www.weareaccurateautomotive.com/blog-0/bid/128677/Tires-for-All-Wheel-drive-vehicle-Beware (in this case it was due to a different tread design) So to be clear, by replacing the two tires we reduced the circumference differential by .75\" and the tread depth by 2/32nds. This is supposed to be good. The speed rating was identical, but the tread design was different. We concluded that the tread design was the culprit.

      "question": "Engine braking with an automatic transmission",
      "context": "For reference, I've reviewed these three questions: Manually shifting an automatic transmission? Does Downshifting (Engine Braking) Cause Extra Wear and Tear? Is engine braking harmful? I drive a (new to me) 2011 Nissan Sentra. The transmission is automatic, and as with most newer cars, it has overdrive. I'm always wary of wearing my brakes (and particularly the correlation between braking and gas mileage), so I try to avoid hitting them when it's possible. If I see somewhere that I'll need to slow down, I try to coast for long enough that I don't have to touch the brakes. Failing that, I use engine braking to slow down whenever I can. Here's where I deviate from those questions. First of all, my engine is an automatic, so the answers relating to manual transmissions seem like they might be missing some critical parts. Also, I don't have any large hills I'm braking down, this is almost exclusively before / at a stoplight (so that I barely brake, just slow crawl, then accelerate when it",
      "answer": "My process is generally: - 70-80 mph = coast to 60 - 50-60 mph = switch overdrive off, RPMs jump to ~3500, engine brake to 25 - 20-25 mph = shift from \"D\" (assuming 3rd gear here) to \"L\" (assuming 1st and 2nd) This gets me down to about 10 mph, and I've never seen the RPMs go anywhere close to red line. If this is your procedure, you're well within the engineering tolerances of the design. Your car is not dealing with any kind of excess load. All is well. With this assumption, I feel that switching it off to engine brake will not damage the transmission, as it's merely downshifting, which is exactly what engine braking is about. Is this correct? Yes, you are correct. This problem clearly illustrates the situation: the overdrive button just allows the transmission to select an even higher gear, primarily for increased mileage at high speeds. Finally, and I believe this is very important to this discussion: by all accounts (manual, dealership, online), my 2011 Nissan Sentra has a Continuously Variable Transmission. I don't understand transmissions well enough to comprehend the subtle differences, but I do know the CVT has the option of infinite gear ratios, which means it can't possibly be a traditional \"gear\" transmission. Yes, this does make quite a difference in terms of the design but it doesn't change any of the fundamental answers. Using the pictures from the Nissan CVT overview site: You can see that there are two variable diameter pulleys connected by a very robust belt. As you say, this theoretically allows for an infinite number of gear ratios. Practically, there are plenty of engineering and human interface limitations that reduce infinity to a more manageable set of presets. There is a finite resolution of the pulley adjustment mechanism that allows the engine computer to direct the transmission. This means that, while not quite infinite, you probably have many many more effective gears settings than the five choices I have in my car.",

Two on the axes, and one on the same shaft as the combustion motor (C-motor), which connects to the axes via a hydraulic coupling and a differential with a ratio of 2.73 Now, let's play with that numbers. The C-motor has its red line at 8250RPM, so it turns the axes at 8250RPM/2.73=3022RPM. The rear wheel dimensions are 345/30 R20 Y, which means they have a circumference of 2.17m. So, at max RPM, the car does 2.17m * 3022RPM = 6558m/min or 393km/h. They don't state a top speed, but they write something like 20s from 0 to 400km/h. So it is feasible that the C-motor is connected to the axes via a 2.73 ratio differential. However, the car would drive at 47km/h when the motor is at 1000RPM... The solution is also written in the text of the website: Koenigsegg has developed a clutch-slip mechanism that uses the hydraulic coupling to convert torque at medium/high speeds during fast acceleration. This allows the combustion engine to gain revs and power, thereby giving the sensation of a traditional downshift with the associated aural enjoyment, even without the traditional gearbox. So, the answer to your original question is: They do have a torque converter like most other automatic cars, just a bit bigger / more sophisticated, so it can replace a gearbox. (And I wonder why the put that third E-motor onto the shaft of the C-motor - a torque converter always steals some power, i.e. fuel/battery. But I guess that doesn't matter here, people are interested in peak performance, not efficiency / endurance)",

I am curious to know how is this different from a traditional manual transmission (ignore the CVT , i know how that works). What is the purpose/advantages of the AMT over the DSG and traditional type. What category does the DSG from Volkswagen group come into.",
      "answer": "Automated manual transmission is a kind of semi automatic transmission. The actual gear box will similar to the ones that you find in manual transmission, however the clutch control and gear shifting is automated. Mercedes had an AMT called sequentronic. Direct shift transmission (getriebe in German) has two intermediate shafts with alternate gears (one shaft has gears 1,3,5 and the other one has 2,4,6,R). In DSG, the next gear is preselected. There are two dry clutches, one for each intermediate shaft, and during gear shifting one clutch is engaged and another disengaged. VW uses DSG and Ford calls them DCT (dual clutch transmission). Neither of the transmissions above have a planetary gear box or a torque converter, which are standard in a conventional automatic transmission.",

      "question": "Why do we push start cars in second gear?",
      "context": "I always wondered why you have to be in second gear when push starting a car. I know what all the process does, so my thought is that it would be better to do it in first gear. I think this because in first gear you can have more rpm with less speed (compared to second gear), so that means less effort, less time pushing the car, and therefore, less distance to do it. In fact, one day it happened to me that my car's battery was dead and I was alone, and as I couldn't gain much speed alone, I tried with first gear and it was perfect! So, why is it common to hear that \"it has to be done in second gear\"? Can I break something if I do it in first gear?",
      "answer": "It doesn't \"have to be done in second gear\". It just usually works easier to do it there. The reason is simply as you put it, that being it isn't trying to spin the engine as fast in 2nd gear as it would be in 1st. If the engine is a little harder to start, you won't be wasting all of the momentum trying to get 1st gear to kick over. In 2nd gear, the momentum will carry the engine longer and make it easier to start. I'd suspect by this same logic you could transfer this to 3rd or 4th gear, but I would suspect there is also a point of diminishing returns. There really isn't or should be any fear of breaking something, other than your back as you push the car around the block. There isn't enough torque being put on anything to cause any damage. The engine and vehicle dynamics puts way more stress on the components just driving and doing normal stuff than you could do by push starting it.",

Unfortunately, the manual does not explain the mechanism by which the overheating occurs, so I have no idea whether it can affect other cars.

      "answer": "@dude's answer reminded me to come back and look at this question. If it hadn't been for the RX-7 I would have argued pretty strongly that all manual cars can coast quite happily downhill in neutral, however I have learned from my mother in law, who has an RX-7, that rotary engines cars have some very odd problems: Running the engine for less than a couple of minutes can flood the engine so badly it needs to be towed for 5 minutes just to clear the engine. Oil flow is so marginal and leaky that bad weather can make the difference between it overheating or just failing to start. Plus other issues, so I reckon your question is almost the wrong way round. It could be \"is the RX7 the only car you can't coast downhill with\" :-)",

      "question": "How come gears don’t normally change in an automatic car?",
      "context": "I know that there is a similar question here, and another one here that asks when an automatic gearbox knows how to change gear, but I want to know exactly how it does that. It was brought to my attention recently that the gears don't \"shift\" in an automatic gearbox as one might expect them to. Instead there are a number of gears that at different speeds to somehow create different gear ratios. I've seen this video but apparently that is a very simplistic explanation to how it all fits together and doesn't tell me anything about what it actually looks like, only what happens inside to some extent. How exactly does the automatic transmission work? How are all the gears held in place? What does the transmission system look like in reality?",
      "answer": "Your question is incredibly board because it can be broken into 5 distinct aspects; planetary gear sets operation, clutch and band operation, torque converter operation, control system operation and the power flow through the transmission. Further complicating the answer is that there are hundreds of different types, kinds and transmission manufacturers. For the rest of the response i will focus on the power flow through the transmission assuming that you already know how everything else works. I gave a description of how the transmission contort system works in this post and how the overrunning or sprag clutch works in this post. I will be describing the Chrysler 3 speed Torqueflite transmission. It is the simplest of the transmissions and in school this transmission was used as an example for basic transmission operation. The transmission has these basic components; input shaft, front clutch, reverse clutch, kick down band, low and reverse band, kick down planetary gear set, intermediate shaft, reverse planetary gears set and output shaft. The input shaft turns both clutches. The front clutch is attached to the ring gear of the kick down planetary gear set through the intermediate shaft. The reverse clutch is attached to both the sun gears of the planetary gear sets, the kick down band can also stop the same assembly. The output shaft, kick down planet carrier and reverse ring gear are all tied together. Finally the reverse planet carrier is tied to a overrunning clutch and can be held by the low reverse band. First Gear In firs gear only the front clutch is applied. The front clutch transfers rotation from the input shaft to the intermediate shaft then to the kick down ring gear. From here it gets complicated because there is a double gear reduction that is hard to see. The kick down ring gear turns the kick down planets. The kick down planets drive the out put shaft. The kick down planets also drive the kick down sun which in turn causes the kick down planets to",

      "answer": "I did a little research today and it does appear to be a little odd. Apparently, the motivation is that they'd like to have a maintenance free transmission (i.e., no holes for customers to insert too much fluid into). The best summary I've been able to find is as follows: The transmission fluid must start at lower than 35°C. Raise the vehicle on the lift, put the transmission selector in Park and leave the engine idling. Check the fluid level at the inspection hold at the bottom of the oil pan. At the correct level, a small amount of fluid will come out of the inspection hole when the fluid temperature is between 35°C and 45°C. All that said, I can appreciate why they'd like to keep the casual customer out of the transmission....",

      "question": "2 Volts on Car Battery",
      "context": "My car battery has gone completely flat after leaving my car parked up for about a month. Tried turning over the car today, and none of the lights on the dash light up. Ran a multimeter across the terminals, and it shows 2 volts. This battery is under a year old in age, and has never been jumped before. It is a value brand battery, so cheap and not great. I can jump the car, but I imagine it will put undue stress on the alternator. Is it even worth my time bringing the battery to the local car parts place for a trickle charge, or should I bite the bullet and get a new battery for roughly 100EUR ?",
      "answer": "Since you have a battery which isn't that old (most batteries have about a five year life span), I'd suggest you put it on a charger and try to recharge it. This will allow the battery to come back to full charge without putting an undue stress on your alternator. You have to decide if the time spent in recharging the battery is worth your time. To me, 100EUR would be well worth my time as long as I have a spare vehicle to utilize in the mean time. While this episode of having to recharge the battery will have taken a toll on the battery (shortened its lifespan), it will most likely be able to take the charge and will work fine for you for the foreseeable future. Another thing to think about, though, is if the battery is only a year old, it may still have the manufacturer's warranty in place. If this is available, you may just take it in and say, \"I'll take my replacement, please.\" ... especially if there is a priority need for the vehicle.",

      "answer": "This step is a carryover from days gone by and is not needed in modern vehicles. Batteries from 50 or 60+ years ago were not as powerful or reliable as modern ones. Older batteries had difficulty handling the load of the starter motor alone. Engines cranked longer before starting and were cranking large displacement engines. Any added load from wiper, radio heater fans, etc. while starting may have prevented the engine from starting. Realizing this modern cars disconnect everything that isn't needed to get the engine running during the crank cycle. You can test this yourself by leaving the radio on. You notice the radio plays with the ignition in the \"on\" position but shuts off in the \"start\" position.",

      "context": "My e46 M3 would not start when I got to the parking garage after work. When I first turned the key, I heard a sound like grinding gears, but I was so startled that I immediately stopped trying to crank the engine. The interior lights and radio flashed for a fraction of a second when this happened, and the clock on the dash reset itself. A couple of seconds later I tried cranking again, but all I got was the sound of the starter relay clicking away. The engine did not turn over, nor did I hear any grinding noises. Is it the starter, or something else? How would I check this? I should also mention that I was able to push-start the car and get it running, since it has a manual transmission. Thanks!",
      "answer": "Your battery was dead. In many cars, when the battery can't provide enough cranking amps, you will hear a clicking instead of the normal starting sound. The starter battery draws a lot of current. When that happens, the voltage available to the rest of the system drops dramatically, especially if the battery is weak. That's why your clock reset itself. Hook up a smart charger. A cheap one is a Battery Tender Jr. Avoid a dumb charger, which will gladly push 13.8V at 2A in to your battery until all the electrolyte has boiled away. A good charger will have bulk, absorption, and float stages. A really good one will have a desulfate stage, which can help revive an older battery. You need to figure out whether the problem is in your charging system or in the battery. A mechanic or a battery shop will have a testing tool that will measure the CCA of your battery. To get the best possible test, charge the battery to full, then let it rest disconnected for 24 hours. If the number is very low, your battery can't do the job. Letting a desulfating charger work for a long time may make a difference, but if this is your daily driver and you don't have a spare battery, you probably should just replace it. If you decide to replace your battery, check out How do I apply dielectric grease to my battery? If the battery checks out, then the problem is in your charging system. Perhaps there's a loose connection, or perhaps your alternator is bad. See your service manual for instructions on troubleshooting the charging system. You'll definitely want a good multimeter at this point, with 3 1/2 digits of precision. Remember that batteries have lead, produce hydrogen, and can get acid on things. Nitrile gloves, goggles or face mask, clothes you want holes in, and wash up well afterward.",

      "answer": "Gloves are not essential, but highly recommended When replacing a car battery there are three potential hazards that relate to safety: electrical hazard - the battery is capable of generating 100's of amps' worth of current. You want to avoid shorting the two terminals with something like a wrench, cable or hand jewellery. In this regard, gloves can help reduce the risk of shorting the battery with hand jewellery, but the prudent thing to do is not do anything to short the battery terminals. chemical hazard - battery acid is highly acidic and not to to be messed with. In case the battery water overflows or develops a leak gloves would be essential here, though I don't expect this to be too much of an issue while changing maintenance-free batteries. falling hazard - batteries are heavy and can cause considerable damage if one were to fall on your toes. Gloves won't do much good here (unless they provide better grip). In all situations, the onus is on you to be careful while replacing the battery. Wearing gloves will not guarantee you your safety.",

      "context": "I understand battery maintainers, like those offered under the Battery Tender® brand, are used to keep batteries charged for long term storage, and trickle chargers are.... also used to charge batteries? What are the differences between these two devices, how do they work, what are their applications, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each? EDIT: How does each device effect the long term life of a battery?",
      "answer": "The difference is smarts. A trickle charger provides a constant current all the time. It does not know whether the battery is charged or discharged. A battery tender is smart. It will charge the battery only when it needs charged. After it's done charging it will shut off and monitor the battery state. When it sees the battery get to something like 80% (depends on the tender model) it will charge the battery back up to full and wait again. Tenders are better but more expensive. Tenders charge the battery only when needed; this reduces the wear and tear on the battery. Trickle chargers wear on the battery more. Flooded lead acid batteries are strange creatures. They have a fairly high self discharge rate compared to other chemistries. This means that even sitting on a shelf these will die in 6 months to a year depending on size. They are also filled with water which gives them some strange properties. An automotive flooded lead acid battery (12v) has 6 separate cells inside. Nominally each cell is 2.1V giving a total nominal battery voltage of 12.6v. These cells can and do fall out of balance meaning that one cell could be lower or higher than the rest. As a unbalanced battery charges, some cells will fully charge before others. The battery has an interesting mechanism to keep the fully charged cells from overcharging: it boils off the water. This isn't like a tea kettle whistling but an accelerated evaporation. When the battery is fully charged then all the cell begin to boil. These properties allows the battery to work relatively well in an automotive charging system environment. Because vehicle have a relatively unmanaged charging system the battery holds up well only requiring occasional water top offs. Also batteries like sealed lead acid, absorbed glass mat and gel cell make bad batteries for vehicles because it is bad to take them to 100% charge. Depending on the discharge rate of the battery a trickle charger is meant to off set the discharge rate plus some. ",

Then it occurred to me that this van is also equipped with an auxiliary battery for running a small fridge and some interior lights. I was in a pinch, so I hooked up my jump start cables from the aux battery to the main battery, and was able to successfully start off that. For the record, I temporarily removed the isolation relay that normally enables charging of the aux battery when the engine is running, just to be sure not to cause any damage from this unorthodox setup. The main battery is a regular starter battery (650",
      "answer": "Definitely not optimal, but as you say it'll work in a pinch. That, of course, depends upon the state of the main battery. Even when a battery is \"dead\", it doesn't mean that it's completely flat. It still has some power left in it (lights are dim and the starter only clicks ... but it still has something going on). The overall voltage may be down quite a bit, so it has no chance by itself to start the vehicle. Realistically, just like when you jump start from another car, it only needs a small amount of added juice to make things happen. The deep cycle battery is not designed for this type of use normally, but will make up the difference if needed. As for if you've actually damaged anything, I'd suggest you haven't done that at all, but you've probably shortened the life of the deep cycle battery by a bit. Also, I would bet you would have noticed by now if there were any residual effects of what you do. As long as you take the approach you did with basically taking the deep cycle battery out and using it separately, there really aren't any safety concerns beyond that of normally jumping a vehicle. In my opinion, what you did by removing the isolation system was very wise. I would have done what you did in a heart beat if it were my only option. I would not leave myself or my family stranded if I had some other way to get my vehicle going. In the Army we used to call it a \"Field Expedient Means\" ... you do what you have to do.",

Nissan says that they will replace the whole set for $5499, but I don't trust that they will always do that, so I would rather be able to do this by myself using commodity parts, just in case Nissan change their mind. I know that this is possible on the Toyota Prius. Is there any resource on how to replace/rebuild the batteries in the Nissan Leaf?",
      "answer": "Yes, they can be. You'll probably need to find a company that refurbishes batteries, there's one that I know of in Australia so I'd say (i.e. assume) that there would be services in your area. If you're a bit handy with electrical work, I've seen some people set up arrays of smaller lithiums to achieve the desired outputs for EV applications. It's not going to be \"cheap cheap\" regardless of what you do, but it can save you some money to fix up an older EV as opposed to buy new.",

      "question": "Switching engine coolant with similar properties oil",
      "context": "I was wondering why specific coolants or distilled water is used as a heat transfer liquid for engine cooling instead of just using a separate oil circuit with some type of oil as a heat transfer liquid. Cost issues aside I guess there is (could be created) an oil type available with similar properties (viscosity, heat transfer, heat capacity) to distilled water or coolant mixtures. Even if it would be necessary to re-design some engine elements (radiator tubes, coolant pumps etc) to cope for the differences in liquids properties wouldn't it be an advantage to have oils mixed in case of gasket failure and also if these two had the same properties (and since coolant liquid doesn't get extremely hot with use as to deteriorate) you could use the present \"cooling\" oil in engine oil changes. What might be some preventing issues with this idea?",
      "answer": "There's a very straightforward answer to this question: Water has a much, much higher capability to transfer heat than oil. Even if you were able to overcome the safety and design issues brought up in other answers, you'd still have to overcome the fact that water has a huge performance advantage at transferring heat compared to other common fluids (including oil). Water is essentially the best possible fluid in terms of thermal conductivity; the only fluids that beat it are metals in liquid state (which isn't a practical choice for cooling a car engine made from metal itself). At 75 C, water's thermal conductivity is around .65 W/mK. Typical heat transfer oils are usually around .14 W/mK. Of course, coolant in a typical automobile isn't water, it's usually water mixed with alcohol. Typical mixes cause the conductivity to drop, because water also beats alcohol at heat transfer, but even pure ethylene glycol is .27 W/mK. A typical 50/50 mix puts you in the neighborhood of .45 W/mK, which means that typical water-based coolant has a thermal conductivity three times better than purpose-designed heat transfer oil. Let that sink in. If you wanted to cool your car's engine with heat transfer oil instead of typical water-based coolant, you're operating at a three to one disadvantage in terms of thermal conductivity. This basically means that your coolant system needs to be three times bigger in order to have the same capacity. Radiator size is already somewhat of a limiting factor in terms of how the front end of a vehicle is designed. I don't think anyone wants to drive a car where the radiator needs to be three times bigger than a typical car radiator is today. Oil is really only used for thermal transfer when water is impractical - due to corrosion, conductivity, evaporation, pressure or temperature requirements above what water can handle, or other limiting factors.

      "answer": "I don't have any empirical evidence for this, but would say no for two reasons: An air filter will collect more dust, dirt, and debris until it gets so full that it starts pushing the older dust, dirt, and debris through the filter, which is what you are trying to prevent in the first place. As the air filter collects more dust, dirt, and debris, the filter element becomes more restricted causing less air to flow into the engine, hurting performance and fuel mileage. A dirty filter will not make oil dirtier faster, but as it gets so full and the dust, dirt, and debris (hereafter called \"stuff\") starts pushing its way into the intake tract, it will cause buildup inside the engine. The \"stuff\" will get into the engine combustion chamber and create excess wear on all the moving parts. There is basically no way for the \"stuff\" to get into the oil. Oil gets dirty usually from cleaning excess hydrocarbons off of working parts and from the oil itself breaking down due to heat and age. As far as the difference between new and old filter, a new filter will clean the air: an old filter won't do such a good job.",

It had been sitting in the garage for a while (years, actually), so I did a fluid refresh, changed the fuel, changed the oil, and changed the coolant. After fixing an air pocket in the fuel line I was able to get it running and driving and everything seemed fine. The Problem However, when I got home I checked the oil level and found it was very high. I thought perhaps I'd added way too much oil on accident, so I changed the oil again, drove the car again, and found the oil level had risen again. Possibilities As far as I know there can only be two places additional fluid could be coming from. Either coolant is entering the oil, or fuel is entering the oil. The liquid in the oil pan is not milky. I've smelled it, and it smells like motor oil, perhaps tinged with the smell of gasoline. I tried burning some, but it didn't ignite, so if the additional fluid is gasoline there isn't enough to burn well. I have to conclude it's fuel in the",
      "answer": "If the car has a mechanical fuel pump (which the 289 did have), please check that the diaphragm in the fuel pump is not leaking. When the pump is not used for a long spell, the rubber diaphragm can dry rot and crack, letting fuel into the crankcase. On a car that old, a new pump would probably be a good investment even if it isn't the cause of the leak.",

Please give a brief summary of all of them if you can. There can't be that many!",
      "answer": "There are quite a lot of different fluids inside a modern car. I tried to group them by purpose. Hydraulic Fluids General use: Hydraulic fluids are used to transfer power from one point to another Brake Fluid - Based on glycole-ether, mineral oil or silicone oil. Brake fluids are designed to have high boiling points because the brake system is subject to a lot of heat and hydraulic systems need incompressible fluids to work. If the break fluid starts boiling, it turns into gas - which is compressible. In this case the force from the brake pedal is used to compress the gas instead of moving the brake pads, resulting in a brake failure. Brake fluid is transported by the brake cylinder which is driven by your foot and supported by engine vacuum if your engine is running and equipped with a vacuum servo / brake booster. Power Steering Fluid - In most cases based on mineral oil. Often ATF (see below) is used as hydraulic fluid inside the power steering. Transported by a mechanical pump driven by the crankshaft using a v-belt. Clutch Fluid - In some cases the clutch fluid and brake fluid are in the same circuit. That means they share the same reservoir and have separate hydraulic cylinders. Even if they don't have the same reservoir, in most cases the clutch fluid itself is just brake fluid. It is transported by mechanic pressure from your leg. Lubricants General use: Lubricants are used to minimize friction between moving parts. This leads to (significantly) longer lasting components. Engine Oil - transported by a mechanical pump inside the engine (driven by crankshaft) Gear Oil / Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) - I dont't know for sure - but I think its transported inside the gearbox by the gears themselves. If the transmission is equipped with an transmission oil cooler it could be transported with some kind of pump. Differential Oil - transported inside the differential by the differential gears - if the car is equipped with a differential oil cooler it's moved by ",

      "answer": "The flap allows oil to move freely in one direction and slows it down going the other. The free direction of flow is usually towards the oil sump pickup. This helps ensure there's a ready amount of oil for the oil pump to feed vital parts of the engine. NOTE: In your picture, you're pointing to the top portion of the device. It's actually the bottom which moves. The top part is stationary. These are readily used in performance applications. The below image shows an add-in aftermarket baffle system from Holley which is used in a GM LTx engine oil pan. It completely surrounds the oil pump pickup, allowing oil to freely enter, but slowing down its escape, only doing it from all directions. It is primarily advertised for road racing applications where there are a lot of lateral G's from all directions involved (braking, speeding up, cornering). It can, however, be used on the street without detriment to the engine or oiling system.",

      "answer": "I observed this same situation in my 1997 Integra back in the day. If you look at the summary on Wikipedia, you can see why the oil pressure is critical to VTEC: At the switch point a solenoid is actuated which allows oil pressure from a spool valve to operate a locking pin which binds the high RPM cam follower to the low RPM ones. So, without sufficient oil pressure, the VTEC system can't execute the shift from low rev to high rev cam lobes. Now, as you observe, the VTEC issue is a later symptom indicating low oil so my advice is not to wait until you see that code before you check the oil....",

This image shows some oil before and after being exposed to the sun for 5 days: That said, the opaque bottle your oil is in (and even the clear-ish strip on the side) will block most, if not all, of the UV light. If you're really worried, you can buy a 1L bottle of the same oil and compare it with whats in your 5L jug, but I don't think there's going to be an issue.

From putting 150k of the 200k miles on my current daily driver I'll tell you that initially I used Valvoline high mileage religiously, but when I need oil (slow leak) in a pinch, I'll pull up to the nearest gas station and grab the cheapest 10w-30 they got, and like I said -- I'm somewhere in the vicinity of 200k miles (digital odometer died) and the engine runs smooth if I do say so myself. I've always (usually) followed the advice: keep the oil changed. You probably know after so long the oil will change it's viscous properties, which can be bad for the engine.

      "question": "Evans Waterless Coolant",
      "context": "I've seen advertisements for Evans Waterless Coolant and have seen Jay Leno tout it on his YouTube channel. My question deals with the operation of the cooling system after you have properly introduced the coolant into the system. Once converted, the system (as the name implies) will not have any water in it. The operating ranges of Evans is from -40°F to 375°F and won't boil or evaporate until the high end. Most engines run under 250°F. Considering this, the engine will never boil over under normal operating conditions. My questions are: Could you run your cooling system with no pressure? Would there even be pressure, considering the evaporation of water in a regular system is what causes the pressure in the first place? What other benefits could come from running a waterless coolant? (This would be besides the obvious things like no corrosion or electrolysis.)",
      "answer": "Hmmm, about the benefits/drawbacks, I first wanted to complain that this stuff only has a heat capacity of 2.6J/(g * K), while water has 4.2J/(g * K). Water has an exceptionally high value, which makes it a great coolant, while other liquids are normally in the range below 2.4J/(g * K). However, water is usually mixed with anti-freeze, a 1:1 mixture has a value of 3.2J/(g * K). So your liquid isn't that much worse. However, the liquid has a viscosity of 2000(mPa * s) at -40°C, while the standard 1:1 mixture has about 100(mPa * s), and pure anti-freeze has in the order of 1000(mPa * s). This means the stuff seems to be comparable with pure anti-freeze, though they don't state values for high temperature. So, since the heat capacity is a little lower and the viscosity much higher, the performance of this product is not as good as of the standard mixture. But it's impossible to say how the performance actually is. Besides lack of corrosion. I can't see a benefit. May be others can? About the pressure: Put some water into a closed, air-filled cavity, and heat it. When the temperature rises, more and more water evaporates, and the pressure rises exponentially. At 100°C, there's an overpressure of 1atm w.r.t ambient pressure in the cavity. At 120°C, it's already 2atm. If the cavity is opened now, the pressure expands, and since the water is hotter than 100°C, it will boil over. (physically speaking: The water wants to maintain the over pressure by evaporating as fast as it can) For the mixture, the values are 0.9atm and 1.4atm, since the boiling point is higher (about 110-115°C) This product has to be heated to 191°C / 375°F to generate a pressure of 1atm, so the pressure will be much much lower at typical motor temperatures. Finally, a typical cooling system must be pressure tight to increase the boiling point, since motor temperatures can rise above the boiling point. But this is not necessary for this product. On the other side, the system is made pressure tight, some ",

      "question": "What is the point of heating the IAC Valve?",
      "context": "I recently added a cold air intake and cleaned the throttle body and IAC valve (I was having hunting idle issues) on my '01 Accord V6, and I noticed that there were coolant lines running through the IACV. Instead of reconnecting them, I bypassed the flow with a loop of transmission hose and instead routed the breather intake through it which now cools it instead of heats it. I did that because I noticed that the hunting idle only happened when I started the car warm. Since I did all that, the idle is perfect and steady. I understand that heating the IACV is supposed to prevent icing that might cause the valve to stick, but I haven't had any issues with that. I've even run it on 20-30F mornings and the IACV, throttle body, and even the manifold will stay cool to the touch, but nowhere near cold enough to cause icing. I guess my question is did I miss something big about the design of the IACV system or is heating it extraneous in my car?",
      "answer": "The use of the IAC and coolant running through it are just as you speculated: to prevent icing. In most places there really aren't any issues with the freezing issue. Even in cooler climates, there usually aren't any issues. As we all know, when there is a tremendous amount of air moving in/around/over a metal object, there is usually a cooling effect, especially if the metal in question is aluminum. Diverting or bypassing the IAC's coolant flow can actually give a slight performance boost in some cases. While the coolant flow through the IAC can help prevent icing, it has a bad side effect after the engine is warmed up: it heats the incoming air flow, which degrades performance due to a less dense air mixture. Bypassing the coolant flow allows the incoming air to be closer to incoming air and therefore will be denser going into the engine and make more power. This usually isn't a lot of extra power. In vehicles with larger V8 engines, it can be upwards of 15 wheel horsepower. In a little I4, the gains will not be as noticeable. For the most part, as long as you diverted the coolant flow and not plugged hoses, you should have no issues. In some applications, the coolant flow is crucial to maintain how the system works. If you plugged the hoses, this can cause a disruption in the normal flow, which may have side effects. As long as the coolant continues to flow through the hoses as it should, there won't be an issue with this.",

      "answer": "A muffler is a harmonically tuned chamber that is designed to reduce the noise created by the combustion process. Mufflers are usually designed with specific sound frequencies in mind. When a vehicle is being designed, the engineers will measure the sound frequencies emitted by the engine, and using harmonic tuning, create mufflers that specifically cancel certain frequencies, and amplify others (ie in a sports sedan, you want quite exhaust at low throttle/low RPM, but louder exhaust at high throttle or high RPM). The image below is a cutout of a typical muffler. You can see the exhaust gasses and sound waves will enter (on the left) and exit (out the top). The baffling allows the exhaust to travel the path of least resistance (once pressure has built), while forcing the sound waves to bounce around through the various tubes and chambers, thus canceling the desired frequencies. The volume of the sound baffling chambers is why mufflers are as large as they are. If you were to drill a hole in your muffler, the sound waves would be allowed to escape before the baffling has taken full effect, making your exhaust louder. The sound of your drilled exhaust would change based on where you drilled the hole, drilling in one spot might effect the entire rev range, while other spots might only effect the sound at high RPM. Tuners will design mufflers with different baffling/chamber designs to amplify the sound and volume of certain frequencies.",

      "context": "I'm toying with turbojet engine ideas, and over the course of my research it occurred to me that the combustion chamber could be more power-efficient and space-efficient if it was aligned in the desired direction of airflow. That said, if the combustion chamber is 1-2 feet long, and both the intake and exhaust turbo manifolds need to connect directly to opposite ends of the combustion chamber, then the intake and exhaust portions of the turbo would need to be separated from each other and the shaft extended to allow room for the combustion chamber. Basically something like the picture below, but with the combustion chamber rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise-ish to eliminate the long intake tube. If the shaft were extended, and the compressor further distanced from the turbine, how would this affect the central bits of the turbocharger, and the oil circulation? (Source for the photo, and here's what it looks like when operating.)",
      "answer": "A few things to consider if you end up doing this: A longer shaft will reduce the speed that you can safely spin the turbos up to It's got to do with something engineers call rotordynamics, although I highly doubt you would need to spin something up to 125,000 RPM for a turbojet application :) You may also find that the existing journal bearings are not adequate for the requirements for the purposes of rotordynamic stability, so choose your turbo wisely Consider modifying the oil supply system The shaft on an automotive turbo is relatively short, so both turbine-side and compressor-side bearings can be fed by a common oil supply. As you want to do away with the turbo housing, you will probably have to make it the oil supply system external to it.",

You can repack your baffles, as you suggested, and then use the rivet gun. As an aside, tin cans are good for gerry rigging exhaust. They can take heat better than aluminum cans. You can drill out a tin can and jam into your exhaust and rivet it into place as a temp solution. If you don't know much about tuning your carburetors, don't do this one as it will mess up your mixture. You can use pieces of a tin can in riveting your baffle and what not too.

      "answer": "When I got my Refrigerant Handling Certification from MACS many years ago, we were sworn to use a proper recycling machine, which captured everything and filtered out air, oils, and moisture. The refrigerant could then be re-used for the same or different vehicle. This was the transitional time, and there was much concern of a cheap \"retrofit\" DIY job creating a mix of R-12 \"Freon\" and R134a, which no machine could deal with. When such contaminated refrigerant mixes were discovered, the offending stuff was shipped back to the manufacturer, or one of their agents, and destroyed - I know not by what manner - but I believe it was controlled incineration (Burning R-12 creates a sort of Mustard Gas) and that the process was very, very expensive. Most cases involved shipping and disposing of the \"contaminated\" recycling machine as well. I know many otherwise excellent and devout shops that illegally vented such systems, rather than incur a $10-$20k hazardous waste disposal incident. In truth, vacuuming for retrofit wasn't enough... there was always some residual chlorinated refrigerant stuck in the mineral oil, and the PAG oil wasn't sufficient viscosity to move it into solution. Now with advent of R1234yf, this will eventually put me out of the A/C repair business.

I checked with couple garages near by. Cost for checking AC is vary from $60 to $150. They told me it covers only investigating NOT fixing cost. So, the question come up to my mind is: Can I keep charging R134a without getting it to repair? Will it have serious damage to my car? Is it good thing or bad thing?",
      "answer": "I assume that when you mentioned that the recharge only lasted for a month, that was until the a/c stopped working again? Usually a/c stops working when there is not enough pressure in the system due to it being low on refrigerant and given how long a non-leaking system normally lasts without a recharge, you've got a fairly substantial leak in a/c terms. You can probably get away with a couple more recharges but keep in mind that the refrigerant also includes the lubricating oil for the system and if you keep topping up the refrigerant, the ratio might be off, which can do further damage to the a/c system and your wallet. I would consult the local yellow pages for an automotive a/c guy - a lot of garages (especially the smaller ones) don't have the gear and licenses to deal with a/c anyway so they often farm it out to a mobile guy. Getting said mobile person to come out and check out your car's a/c will at least save you the overhead the garage charges on top of what the a/c person charges. Also, the reason that they're only quoting you for the diagnostics is that in order to find a leak, some refrigerant will have to be replaced by a UV dye, then you get to run your car for a few days with the a/c on before the actual leak check can be done. Only at this point it's even possible to figure out what needs replacing as it can be anything from the compressor to a line to the evaporator or receiver/dryer. And without knowing where it leaks you can't diagnose the problem in the first place.",

      "question": "My AC works well at night only",
      "context": "I'm unhappy with the performance of my '04 Pontiac GTO's AC. Here are the symptoms: Cooling goes down to zero when the car is stationary, starts to cool after the car has been moving for some time It doesn't cool enough during the day (~ 35-45 °C ambient temperature) It cools quite well at night (even when stationary) It is ice-cold five minutes into continuous driving at night. I replenished the Freon (R134a) and noticed just a marginal improvement. The symptoms suggest to me that the cooling bottleneck is in the heat-rejection portion of the AC system. The radiator fans work. And it doesn't look like there's anything obstructing the AC condenser. What could be wrong?",
      "answer": "You say the radiator fans work but those conditions sure sound like you aren't getting airflow when stopped. I say this based on your symptoms: Cooling goes down to zero when the car is stationary, starts to cool after the car has been moving for some time When stationary you are relying on the fan(s) to move air through the condensor to keep the system cool It doesn't cool enough during the day (~ 35-45 °C ambient temperature) This part shouldn't be fan reliant so there may be some other impacting issue also such as low pressure, damaged condensor or undersized condensor for the ambient temperatures It cools quite well at night (even when stationary) At night with the lower temperature, even stationary, the condensor may be getting enough cooling performance just from the ambient air and so lack of operating fan wouldn't hurt it It is ice-cold five minutes into continuous driving at night. This is the ultimate perfect conditions for it, cool air rushing into the front of the car because you are moving, no fan needed There should be an electric fan that is turned on when the A/C is running. Start the car, get it up to operating temperature and turn on the A/C. Then check to see if that electric fan is running. If it isn't, there may be a wiring issue or an issue with the fan itself. If it is running, then you need to look at other areas. You said you replenished the R134a, was this with a do it yourself bottle or did you take it in? If done yourself, you may need to take it in and get the pressure checked, make sure there isn't a refrigerant leak. If you took it in, talk to the shop, find out if they pressure tested the system, if not, then the same issue may apply. Perform a visual inspection of the condensor, make sure there isn't a large section of bent/damaged fins. Some is ok, it is going to happen, but the more that are damaged the lower the efficiency of the condensor. Check the tension of the compressor's belt. If there is a significant change in ambient tem",

      "context": "We have a 2014 Subaru Forrester whose AC Compressor clutch operation is unlike other cars I've ever owned. The video linked is from when the car is cold and AC is engaged. It appears that the clutch is slipping for the first few seconds, but the loud buzzing and noise accompanying engagement remain until warm. The clutch engages fully once warm as well. According to the dealership this is all normal and refuse to replace the compressor until it completely fails and don't care that the noise makes the vehicle sound like a junker. Careless; considering a slipping clutch will eventually lead to bearing failure, a break of the serpentine belt, and overheating of the engine leaving us stranded.

      "answer": "Ultimately, I had to make enough of a stink with the original dealer citing the operation of other compressors to have the component replaced. Subaru America was of no help as they weren't even able to get the service manager to call them back. Addition Info: The dealership claimed they were only doing this for customer satisfaction and at no point agreed that the compressor or parts were malfunctioning. They opted not to review the video and made the claim that this vehicle's clutch operated as designed (gradually engaging magnetic clutch), but considering the replacement's operation, see this is not the case. The compressor has since been replaced, and has been working with no issues (so far). The pulley is engaged fully when the clutch is energized and there is no extended buzzing. The compressor, its clutch, and pulley look a bit different then the original. Pictures, video to follow.",

      "context": "Before I ruin my dashboard/car, I wanted to know if my approach is correct. I don't know much about cars but logically, it seems like a simple enough task to remove vents, reach in and grab items, replace vents. Some items fell down the center air vents in my car. I want to get them out for various reasons. I was thinking of two approaches: Remove the center dash and reach in to grab them Open the glove compartment, remove the cabin air filter and see if I can reach items in the center vent area. I bought this plastic tool mentioned in forums to pry the dash and/or push clips in the dash to open it. I found on forums and youtube videos how to remove the center air vents in my car but I wanted to know once I get it open, how far do I have to reach into the internals to retrieve the items or can the items move to other areas in the vent system and it would take more effort to track them down than just opening the vent and reaching in? The items are some coins from a preschooler, a small ",
      "answer": "While the HVAC system paths will vary greatly between cars, try these first: If the items are metal or contain metal, use an extendable magnet to reach straight in, or if it is further in then use a magnet tied to a string or dental floss. You can use a long hook (used in dentistry) to reach in and hopefully loop the item, or again attach it to a string/dental floss to feed it deeper into the vent. If both of these fail, look for the joints between the HVAC pathways where the item(s) may have came to rest. Sometimes they can be separated without removing anything else, but I have rarely been successful in getting these apart without removing some dash components.",

Car had been not running for a couple of days but nothing was left on. Since the battery was under warranty, I replaced it. Charging system is OK (about 14V, and this problem only happens when the car sits for a couple of days). The only issue I noticed was that the radio stayed on when the ignition was off (though the clock display did go out), but maybe it is not related. Anyway I turned off the radio. For about 2 weeks all was well, every day or two I checked the battery voltage and it was OK. Then a couple of days ago it was discharged again (about 8.5V). So first I charged the battery and the voltage has remained about 12.7V with nothing connected. So it seems like some intermittent electrical drain is happening.

      "question": "Semi-permanent power inverter",
      "context": "I'd like to install a semi-permanent 500 watt inverter connected to the car battery for greater power delivery. The battery is in the passenger area, so there's no need to run wiring through the firewall. I plan to connect the inverter's ground to the body and the positive directly to the battery with a fuse inline. Here are my questions: I'm concerned about leaving the inverter on when the car is parked and draining the battery. How hard would it be to wire the inverter so that it is only enabled when the engine is running, or at least when the accessories are on? Should the inline fuse rating match the inverter rating, or are there other factors to consider? What type of connector should I use to allow quick (safe) disconnect of the inverter leads so I don't have to take the ring terminals off the battery. How can I find out the car's alternator rating to ensure I don't overload it? Thanks.",
      "answer": "With inverters you also have to take into consideration the efficiency of the inverter itself when calculating power requirement. For example: 12V outlet is rated at about 10A or 120W. Inverter is 87% efficient. 120W * .87 = 104.4 W =Max size of inverter to use is 100W You can use a battery isolator -check at places that sell equipment for RV's. A battery isolator is a device with 2 diodes inside. The center connection is for the output of the alternator, the one on the left goes to the car's starting battery, the one on the right goes to your inverter battery. Since diodes conduct in one direction both batteries don't discharge and only function when charging. Assuming that your inverter is 500W @ 87% = 500/.87 = 574W used at 12V @ 48A The alternator rating should be listed in owner's manual or written on the back of your alternators casing somewhere. The bonus feature of a battery isolator is in winter if you a little juice to crank over- just use a single battery cable short the right and left terminal and jump start your vehicle.

      "context": "According to this survey, electrical parts in motorcycles are the most probable to fail. Which of the electrical parts in modern motorcycles are necessary for maintaining basic driving capacity? In order to make the question more clear, I would like to make an analogy from a motor cycle to a computer program (since this is my area of expertise). Let's assume that we are dealing with a program that can be operated via a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a text-based command-line interface (CLI). In modern software engineering, programs tend to be very modularized with the separate modules ideally being as independent as possible from each other. In the case of this example this would mean that the GUI and CLI are separate modules that don't depend on each other (i.e. if one fails, the other one will still work). Now consider that to operate the program we normally use the GUI, but one day the GUI stops working. Since the error cannot be fixed easily we resort to the CLI for now.",
      "answer": "Generally manufacturers aren't going to waste money on unnecessary components. You've got electrical components to: provide spark to the engine. an on/ off / kill switch to control engine on or off. power the fuel pump (on a modern fuel injected bike). power to the engine control computer, and its sensors and subsequently the fuel injectors (on a modern fuel injected bike.) power headlamp for night time driving. (so you can see the road.) power tail lamp for night time illumination (legal requirement) power turn signals, front and rear (legal requirement for mfgr.) power rear brake lamp (legal requirement) power horn (legal requirement) power gauges as appropriate (speed? warning lights, odometer,etc.) power for the starter motor. (have you ever tried kick starting a big engine? its hard work.) power for license plate illumination (legal requirement) Alternator / regulator / battery (provide electricity and storage of same) If you are going to the Walking Dead apocalypse, all you really need is the stuff that provides spark to the engine, and power for the fuel pump and the engine control computer. You will need a kill switch, alternator, battery. If you want to drive at night, add the headlamp. Electric Starter is optional, but highly recommended. If you could go old skool (bikes built before 2003 or so...) you could go carbureted bikes (in lieu of fuel injection) and kick start. That would save on electrons. If you did old skool daytime walking dead only, you just need ignition coil and spark wiring.. things that generate spark. Add a kill switch, alternator, small battery and that's minimum. If you want a modern fuel injected bike that is safe and legal, then that is exactly what the manufacturer is currently providing (less an extra kill switch or so).",

      "answer": "I think it is more likely that a fault in the rectifier would have the caused the overload of the stator. A bad connection is unlikely to have caused the problem, however a short circuit could have caused it, but that would more likely have blown a fuse first. Extra load on the electrical circuit could have damaged the rectifier and then the stator, especially if they were bypassing a fuse, however heated grips and brake lamps don't sound like they would cause too much extra load.",

Now that I have replaced the pads, the wheel heats up quickly when driving even short distances. I did notice that one of the guide pins seemed stuck - it did not move at all. Could this be the cause of the heat, and if so, what do I need to replace? Just the pins, or the caliper bracket as well?",
      "answer": "If your guide pins are stuck, the caliper won't be able to slide properly. With a sliding caliper, when you apply the brake, the piston pushes one pad against the disc (rotor), and simultaneously pushes back against the caliper (Newton's equal and opposite reactions), causing the caliper to slide along the guide pins, and pull the other pad against the disc. If the caliper cannot slide, the second pad remains forced against the disc, and you're effectively driving with half the brakes on on that wheel, hence why it gets hot. You'll find that if you jack up the the car, that wheel is much harder to turn than the other side. Remove the caliper, and both guide pins. Clean them up until they both slide freely, re-grease and reassemble, using new gaiters if the old ones are damaged (which is quite likely, as that's the usual reason for them siezing).

      "question": "Spongy brakes after brake pad swap - moisture or bubbles?",
      "context": "I changed the rear brake pads on my BMW last week, following the steps outlined in this video. Unfortunately the brake pedal now feels spongy. The pedal feel was firm prior to the brake swap, so it is definitely a sudden change and not a gradual degradation of brake fluid. One thing I forgot to do was undo the brake fluid reservoir cap before pushing the piston calipers back with a C-clamp, so I suspect that the the sponginess is due to trapped air in the system since the reservoir was never exposed to outside air. Or is it possible that the extra pressurization of the system via the C-clamp resulted in moisture absorption? The only issue I see with this reasoning is that the system was never exposed to outside air.",
      "answer": "Two things to look for. 1) air in the brake fluid. 2) incorrectly assembled brake pads, especially the anti noise shims. Air in the brake fluid is the most common cause of low, spongy brake pedal feel. Moisture in the fluid will not substantially change the pedal feel until the fluid temperature exceeds the boiling point of any water in the fluid, then the pedal feel gets very soft. Brake fluid absorbs water if exposed, so the systems are to remain sealed. Brake fluid older than three years or any color other than that of tea should be flushed. Improper assembly of the brakes can cause the pistons to be pushed back too far into their bores when the brakes are released. this cause a longer than normal stroke of the brake pedal before resistance is felt. Also new brake pads installed without surfacing the rotors can result in more pedal effort required for normal braking.",

Start with a 1\" wide, thick blade paint scraper. (Oops.. these are actually called putty knives, not paint scrapers...) Best are the cheap ones in which the handle is riveted on, and the steel runs the length of the handle. Place the sharp edge of the paint scraper in the slight gap between the cast iron housing and the cap. The bevel should be facing you, the flat side against the housing. Tap straight down into the gap. Tap, spin the drum a bit, tap again. repeat. The goal with this tool is to enlarge the gap between the housing and the cap from zero to 1/16\" of an inch or so. Switch over to the cold chisel. Tap again to enlarge the gap from 1/16\" until the part comes free. Again, be careful, go slow.",

This noise only comes when the brakes are applies softly, just enough to slow the car down. Breaking hard, driving normally or accelerating doesn't cause this either. I'm thinking that the changing of the tires has been done incorrectly, but I want to go back to the shop with knowledge. The vehicle is a Honda Civic SI '05 with standard 15\" wheel tires. I'm fairly certain that I have disks on all four wheels. I'd be surprised if it had drums on the back.",
      "answer": "It could be incorrectly torqued wheels, loose disc brake calipers, brake pad shims, suspension pieces loading/unloading from the weight shift. If they just did the tires, take it back and tell them to take a look (for free). Try slowing the car down with the engine. If it's manual, just downshift. If it is automatic, shift the selector to one of the lower gears at speed to force the transmission to downshift. See if the clunk happens. If so, it's probably suspension. If not, brakes.",

      "question": "Prevent (or significantly reduce) brake line rust",
      "context": "I few years back a large chunk of my brake lines were replaced due to a failure in my brake booster. Working on my vehicle now I can see the usual cost of driving on salty winter roads, the lines are starting to look rather corroded; to the point that in the name of preventative maintenance I'll be replacing them sooner rather than later. This time I would like them to last longer than a handful of years in the same climate as what caused the corrosion. What steps in preparation (or install) of brake lines can be taken to decrease the effects of corrosion affecting them? Would painting help, perhaps some sort of undercoating material? Would anti-seize on the line's threads prevent them rusting to calipers and other components? Given this is preventative maintenance and not a repair where loss of drivability is occurring, expect that I have as much time as needed to prepare the lines ahead of time for anything that may take several days to do before install.",
      "answer": "You've got two choices as I see it here to prevent (or significantly reduce) exterior brake line rust: Use stainless steel brake lines. This is a great option, but SS lines (and I'm not talking about braided lines here) is a lot harder to use than regular steel. It is more prone to splitting. The ends have to be treated differently due to this. SS will significantly reduce the amount of corrosion which would be seen on the brake lines, though. When replacing the brake lines, cover them with something like POR15. This stuff bonds with, coats, and changes the metal making it impervious to rust. There are two caveats with this stuff, though. First, you cannot get it onto the fittings. if you do and then tighten it into the caliper or what have you, it will not come apart. It will weld the two pieces together, even worse than rust would do it. Secondly, it cannot be exposed to sunlight for a long period of time. If it is, it will degrade and allow for corrosion. This isn't a problem underneath the car, but thought I'd mention it. Something else to consider with rusted brake lines. Ensure you are changing out the brake fluid every two years or sooner. Brake fluid collects water over time. This make it so the insides of the brake lines corrode as well. Not good to have the lines being eaten away from both sides at the same time.",

      "context": "I had my brake pads and discs changed a few days ago. Should I make any changes to my driving style to \"run them in\" or anything, like not braking hard, or avoiding prolonged breaking?",
      "answer": "Right after they are installed, you should do the following ... if you are few days into the new pads, it's probably too late to do anything special: From 60mph, gently apply the brakes a couple of times to bring them up to operating temperature. This prevents you from thermally shocking the rotors and pads in the next steps. Make eight to ten near-stops from 60mph to about 20 mph. Do it HARD by pressing the brakes firmly, but do not lock the wheels or engage ABS. At the end of each slowdown, immediately accelerate back to 60mph, then apply the brakes again. DO NOT COME TO A COMPLETE STOP! If you stop completely, with your foot on the brake pedal, pad material will be imprinted onto the hot rotors, which could lead to vibration and uneven braking. The brakes may begin to fade after the 7th or 8th near-stop. This fade will stabilize, but not completely go away until the brakes have fully cooled. A strong smell from the brakes, and even some smoke, is normal. After the last near-stop, accelerate back up to speed and cruise for a few minutes, using the brakes as little as possible to allow them to cool down. Try not to become trapped in traffic or come to a complete stop while the brakes are still hot. These steps are taken from the Zechhausen website on bedding brakes. There are other basic methods for doing this as well. You can look at what's on Centric Parts and TireRack.com for their procedures.",

Most cars have servo-assisted brakes (the reason it's much harder to brake if the engine is switched off), which is usually powered by a vacuum line taken off the inlet manifold (so that as the engine sucks in air and fuel, it also sucks air out of the servo). If you look in the engine bay at the point nearest the brake pedal, you'll see the servo - a large round thing about the size and shape of a small casserole, with the brake cylinder stuck to the middle of it. There should be a hose going into this from somewhere. Check all round there for signs of the leak...",

      "question": "What brake components need to be lubricated?",
      "context": "When doing a DIY brake job, I understand that it's necessary lubricate several components of the pad/caliper assembly. From various sources, I have been told that the following are the places where brake grease should be applied: The slide pins connecting one side of the caliper to the other (generously). The hook-shaped bits on either side of the pad which sit on the caliper. The metal back of the pad which contacts the hydraulic piston (lightly). The edges of the hydraulic piston. I've also seen people recommending using anti-sieze lubricant in-between the end of the axle and the rotor, so it's easier to remove the next time the brakes need to be done. My question is, have I missed any important areas that need lubrication? Or included some that really shouldn't be lubricated? Also, I have heard some people say that anti-sieze should be preferred instead of brake grease - is this true?",
      "answer": "Personally, I'm not the hugest fan of anti-seize. I feel like you use it once and it follows you around for the next month. You end up finding it in your sock drawer for heaven's sake. I use similar lube except it's a gold color. It seems to be do lot less following me around, and applies in a much cleaner fashion. Brake Lubrication Lube all contact surfaces between caliper, mount, and pads including: Back side of brake pads Don't forget any shims that are present between the pad and the piston. If the pads have aluminum clips that \"snap\" them into the piston then make sure to lube these. Style points count on this: don't slop it all over the place. I usually explain \"too little\" as: \"If you're trying to be Picasso, you're not using enough\". Put a light layer of lube between the large center opening of the rotor and the hub, and on the rotor hold-down screw, if the vehicle has one. This helps keep the metals from bonding/rusting together and requiring extensive force (some real swings of a hammer) for removal the next time it's needed. If the caliper is equipped with slide pins, then pull them out of the caliper housing, clean them off, apply your lube, and put them back in. Once you have the pins reinstalled, work them back and forth a few times to make sure that the lube is spread properly and there is no binding. If there are metal slides that sit between the caliper and mount, lube (lightly) between the slide and the mount, and also between the caliper mount and where it contacts the brake pad ears. For me, it was easier to just explain how I lube brakes and their components. You seemed to have touched most of the same points as I did. If you end up lubing the area between the hub and rotor, just make sure not to get any anti-seize on the threads of the lug bolts/studs. I hope this helps reassure you about your procedure.",

      "context": "Earlier today I was driving behind a double-trailer dump truck configured something like this: As we approached a red light, the driver obviously applied the brakes, and for the last 50 or so feet before coming to a stop, the rear wheels of the rear trailer were all very obviously locked up as evidenced by clouds of smoke and a nice skid mark from all 4 tires on that axle. This was during normal driving conditions. I don't think the driver was making any kind of emergency stop. Are the rear wheels locking up due to some malfunction, or is this perhaps happening simply because the rear trailer was possibly unloaded? Out of an abundance of caution I made sure to leave an extra comfortable distance. However, other than the spectacular smoke and skidmarks, the vehicle appeared to be under control. Is there any danger to either the truck or to other vehicles (me) when this happens?",
      "answer": "The issue most likely is, the trailer was empty. The brakes are designed to work well when the trailer is full. As you can imagine, if the dump was full of loose gravel there'd be quite a load in it. When the trailer is empty, the same amount of force on the brake pedal can cause the brakes to lock up easily.

      "question": "1 Piece versus 2 Piece Drive Shaft",
      "context": "A guy on a Nissan forum asked why he should keep his 2 piece drive shaft in his truck instead of changing over to a 1 piece version. This was the answer I gave him: The 2 piece drive shaft (DS) is meant to prevent the drive shaft from pulling out under extreme axle movement. The front of the DS slips into the transmission. The rear of the DS bolts to the rear axle. As the suspension travels, a conventional 1 piece DS slips in and out of the \"slip sleeve\" (my term) at the transmission. If the \"slip sleeve\" is short, there is not much room for the axle to move ...or it will fall out. A 2 piece DS fixes the shaft at a central point, preventing the \"slip sleeve\" from coming out as the rear axle moves around. Also, a 2 piece DS will absorb some of the vibrations when a DS is out of alignment (due to dirt or getting bent). That's all I see, anyway. There could be other reasons. OK, now that I've satisfied that person, I want to know the actual reason why automotive manufacturers elect to use",
      "answer": "I think it's more related to the angle of the driveshaft from the transmission to the differential. This way you could have more suspension travel without putting too much constraints on parts. In fact, to answer your question, it may be related to the geometry of the truck/driveshaft that manufacturer will select one type over another one. If the truck is long, you don't want the drive shaft hanging under the truck which can be hit and break. This is where I took my reference. Image source",

Is the transmission (including the synchronous gears) disconnected from the flywheel when the clutch is pressed in? I assume they are disconnected because I can feel the synchronous engaging when I lift my foot off. If they are in-fact connected, why do downshifting methods (e.g double clutching) exist then?",
      "answer": "There are physical limits to sychronizers. When you upshift the synchronizer slows the clutch down which is relatively easy. When you down shift the synchronizer has to speed the clutch up which is much harder. Going down just a single gear is not that bad. When you're on the highway, shifting into first is not possible because you're asking the clutch to speed up to well over 10k rpm. That kind of speed is difficult to achieve if not impossible from just a little puny synchronizer. Further the clutch may come apart from that kind of speed. You miss understand how a synchronizer works. The power train is broken up into 3 pieces; (engine up to and including the flywheel), (the clutch - input shaft - counter shaft - constant mesh gears) and (synchronizer hub-shift sleeve). When you push the clutch pedal the flywheel and clutch disc are disconnected. The sifter is connected to the shift sleeve. When you shift the shift sleeve is slid over by the shifter. The sift sleeve pushes on the struts which in turn push on the blocker ring. The blocker ring pushes agains the synchronizer cone and through friction causes them to match speed. When the speed is the same the shift ring slides into place and engages the dog teeth locking the transmission into gear. The friction between the blocker ring and synchronizer cone is how a synchronizer works. That friction is enough to change the speed somewhat but not a lot.",

Process The clutchless downshift is similar to the clutchless upshift in that it is essentially doing the opposite of the latter. 1. Foot depresses shift lever 2. Grounding switch detects beginning of shift 3. ECU sends signal to throttle body actuator 4. Throttle body actuator momentarily opens butterfly in the throttle body Engine receives enough fuel to momentarily unload force on dog and slot gear relationship in transmission Dog and slot in the gear relationship has force being transmitted through them unloaded and are now able to be separated 5. Riders continued depression of the shift lever forces the shift drum to begin to turn. 6. Shift fork slides unloaded gear out of position/Other gear shift fork slides the next gear into position (these two events are occurring simultaneously). 7. Butterfly closes in throttle body 8. Force from rear wheel that's transferred through the chain and the secondary shaft loads gear with force. 9. Deceleration continues with engine braking engaged and the transmission under load again.",

      "context": "I recently ( and successfully ) rebuilt the engine of my '09 Honda Rebel; she's running well but doesn't want to change gears when idling. If I'm moving she shifts gears without any hanging, grinding, or difficulty. When I'm at a stop, she refuses to change gears. I did learn that I needed to coat the shift tracks and forks with moly grease before re-assembling the engine, so I'm about to open her back up and do this. Are there any other causes I should look out for?",
      "answer": "Turns out the problem had nothing to do with the shift fork, the issue was that the shift lever was contacting the wrong part of the shift drum assembly. Instead of contacting the pins, it was contacting the shaped piece of metal attached to the end - the one that keeps it in the gear the rider has chosen. To fix it I needed to pull the left side cover off to expose the shift lever. There was a shaped piece of metal at the top of the shift drum - it holds the pins in place and works with a lever to keep the shift drum in a particular orientation. I had to remove the lever and the plate in order to move the shift arm into the correct position - with the pins at the end of the drum in the gap between the teeth of the shift fork. After that I simply bolted the plate and the arm back in place.",

Your description leads me to believe it probably has something to do with the clutches being worn out in conjunction with low line pressures (or some such). I would definitely believe the transmission is due for an overhaul. If you pull the dipstick, does the transmission fluid smell burnt and/or appear dark brown in color? If so, this is another tell tale sign. The soft parts in an automatic transmission will only last so long before they start exhibiting these types of problems.

Going about 20 MPH I pushed the gas to the floor and almost nothing happened. The RPMs did not go above 3000. The RPMs also got a shaky and moved back a forth a bit. On the highway the car slowly got up to 45 MPH and 3500 RPM, then it was stuck there for about 15 seconds - it would not go any faster and RPMs would not go higher.

      "answer": "It sounds like the catalytic converter might be plugged. If it has self destructed, it could be causing a blockage and not allowing your engine to exhaust the gasses as it should, thus not allowing the engine to rev as high as it normally should. You can test it by tapping it with a hammer (not hard) and listening to see if there is a rattling sound. A muffler shop can diagnose this for you, as well as fix it if needed.",

      "answer": "The differences between the floor jack and the tranny jack: Tranny Jack has 4 points on a metal plate that can be adjusted to change the angle of the tranny jack and how it meets up with the transmission. This feature is necessary. Tranny jack has a very wide stance to prevent a top heavy jack from falling over with an incredibly heavy item. A wider base is welcome and IMO necessary. Other Notable Attributes Minimum Height - Getting a tranny jack under the vehicle if you don't have a lift is key. Minimum height can be important depending on the make of the vehicle. Max Height - If your working on an F350 Powerstroke max height will be very important. The Challenge I think the biggest hurdle is creating a jack that is stable. I would only use a tranny jack, not a conversion. I've seen trannie's fall over because the right tool wasn't used or a bunch of guys were just trying to manhandle it. If you do a conversion I believe the adjustable plate and a solid base (on wheels) are key to success. The height component is a clear variable that depends on the make and model of the car. If the a tranny jack is too high at it's min height you can always put the car on jackstands. Which, in it's own way, can also be a bit nerve racking. I prefer to have exactly the right tool for a job like this where injury is a real possibility. I'm sure there is an auto store where you can rent one in your area.",

      "answer": "Oil Cooled and Water Cooled are terms used by Manufacturer's to differentiate the slight difference between the cooling systems. Note that this is specific to only motorcycles as almost all of the cars and larger automobiles have moved to Water cooling(Explained below) Oil cooling: Technically , An oil cooled engine is predominantly air cooled with oil cooling assistance, the majority of the heat transfer is through the fins on the cylinder block. Oil Cooling system is generally used for small capacity motorcycles where the engine oil is circulated via an oil pump into a tiny radiator with a fan and back to the sump. Above is an example of a 200CC oil cooled engine.Notice the two tiny tubes connected to a small strip of radiator with a tiny fan at the top. Water Cooling: Now this is the most familiar version of engine cooling technology where a mixture of coolant solution is run through the engine on to a Radiator and back to the reservoir. Almost all cars and modern high capacity motorcycles use this technology as this dissipates heat MUCH more efficiently. Above is a Water cooled engine where you can see there are two noticeable differences , NO Fins on the cylinder head and a Much Bigger Radiator with massive pipes connecting to the cylinder block. Advantages and Disadvantages: The only instance where a manufacturer will use a Oil/Air cooled tech is: To cut down Manufacturing and selling cost of the motorcycle while providing noticeable cooling since motorcycles under 200 CC are generally commuter motorcycles with relatively low compression ratio thus not requiring bespoke Water cooling because they hardly get hot enough to cause damage to engine.They don't even have temp gauges Low maintenance/Rugged Engine since the oil/air cooled engine requires almost no separate maintenance like regulating coolant level etc and smaller radiator means lesser worrying about debris damaging the radiator.Just change engine oil and oil filter and you are basically good to go.

After that The engine temperature rises constantly and (even when it's cold outside) and after the second fan starts it'll cool down immediately. I check radiator water constantly and refill it if needed. Can the engine oil affect engine temperature?",
      "answer": "I don't think so I've had many experiences with strictly oil cooled engines. In particular the 1986 Suzuki GSXR 750/1100 platform. They went strictly oil cooled with a giant oil cooler and 8 quarts of oil. As you can see, this motor is filled with oil galleys and has no coolant or radiator. Another note, I live in the desert of the US Southwest where temperatures exceed 120F in the shade during late June to August. I have never had an issue running 10w-40, 20w-40, 20w-50....so on. Although the 10w-40 is 'less dense' than 20w-50, in theory, I have not detected a difference in power, cooling or engine life. Certainly, comparing this engine to your liquid cooled modern car platform might seem ludicrous but at the end of the day taking the motor I am talking about to a track and running it a very high RPM's in desert summer heat and not detecting a difference in cooling is pretty meaningful. You mentioned I check radiator water constantly and refill it if needed. If you are needing to refill your coolant on a semi-regular basis I suggest you focus on your actual cooling system. I haven't added coolant to my 2013 Toyota Truck for at least 6 months and I'm sure I'll be able to get to summer before I add a little to the reserve reservoir. IMO, focus on the actual cooling system.",

      "context": "I know that engine coolant is a fluid in the engine used to dissipate heat spots and keep the engine cool in general as the moving parts generate heat. In this context, I would call the oil an \"engine coolant\". I also found out what happens when a cars engine doesn't have enough oil in it, which results in overheating among other things. But there is also a radiator in most cars to keep the engine coolant cool. However, due to the fact that oil is too viscous at cold and engine temperature to pass quickly through the thin pipes leading to the radiator to be cooled down by a massive fan. This is where another type of engine coolant comes in - a water based substance. How does the cooling system work (i.e. how is heat passed from oil to water or air)? Is there one pump for the entire cooling system (explain?) or two separate pumps (i.e. one loop for oil, one for water based substance) or more? What exactly is supposedly referred to when someone says \"engine coolant\"? Oil? The water based",
      "answer": "Simple And Technical Definition Of Coolant From a technician's standpoint \"engine coolant\" would be referring to the 50/50 mix of ethylene/polypropylene glycol and water. From an engineers standpoint engine coolant would TECHNICALLY be anything that assists the system in the cooling process. So, in this case you could refer to the fans, oil, and Anti-freeze (The 50/50 mix) as \"coolant\". By definition coolant is any liquid or gas that can be utilized to maintain a desired temperature for any situation needed. Technically \"air\" is a gas of sorts. Fans moving air in a manner that would cool down your engine bay, could be considered a coolant. Not to get to technical, but you asked =) If your average Joe says coolant, they mean the Anti-freeze (50/50 Mix stated above). Pumps In almost every car made from the early 60's, you have pumps for the propulsion of various fluids. The two main pumps are \"water pumps\" and \"oil pumps\". The water pump moves the coolant throughout the engine block, head, and air conditioning heating system. The oil pump moves oil throughout the engine block and head to provide lubrication, cleaning and sometimes pressure to certain internal components that may need it. These systems typically do \"Loop\". The most common return for oil passages are held within the head. The oil pools up just enough to reach holes that take it back to the bottom of the engine. Coolant typically runs on a circuit as well. How these are routed is very specific to the engine manufacturer. 99 percent of the time you have one oil pump and one water pump. Heat Dispersion I will say that your engine Anti-freeze does the majority of work. The reason is because the rate at which it circulates is far quicker than oil. It also has its own cooling assistance (The radiator). The entire system by nature is designed to handle the brunt of the job. Oil does its part as well, but in a bit of a different way. Oil keeps the system cool by minimizing friction. The less friction, the less ",

What actually happens inside the engine to cause it to function incorrectly at higher temperatures? One idea that I had was that the engine coolant will reduce in viscosity. How this makes the engine break down I still have no idea.",
      "answer": "You asked What actually happens inside the engine to cause it to function incorrectly at higher temperatures? Response One of the many ways that engines fail due to high temperature is the increased diameter of a piston due to the heat. As you have noted heat will make things get bigger. In a situation where an engine seizes due to heat the OD (outside diameter) of the piston increases in size so much that is larger than the ID (inside diameter) of the bore it is traveling. Upon seizing because of heat, due to very high friction, the piston stops the crankshaft from turning as the motor cannot create enough power to overcome the friction of the seizing piston in the cylinder bore. Upon cool down of the ICE the piston will shrink and allow the engine to turn over if there is no physical impedance from the actual seizure. In some cases an engine can be started after a heat related seizure. This does not mean that it is good operational order or that lifespan and durability have not effected it. More than likely rings, piston and cylinder bore have irrevocably damaged and require replacement and machining in order for the ICE to continue to operate normally. Other Affects Plain bearings for the crankshaft and connecting rods Radiator/Coolant hoses can burst due to the increased pressure in the cooling system. Radiators that are old or poorly constructed can fail due to increased internal pressure of the cooling system Head gaskets can fail due to the increased temperature of the coolant OR due to warping during cool down or an overzealous operator putting cold water into the radiator before the ICE can cool slowly and evenly Overhead cam cam holders Various other components",

Then discovered cylinders misfiring and only around 1 litre of oil in the engine. I do drive it excessively (that should increase usage) still oil consumption sounds to much for what I am used to. I didn't see any blue fumes coming out of exhaust, so engine would seem to not be leaking oil into combustion chamber. Is such consumption considered to be normal? What oil consumption should I expect?.",
      "answer": "Unfortunately, oil consumption in these engines can be quite large. GM has put out service bulletins which says that engine use up to 1 quart per 2000 miles is perfectly normal. I found some information on the bulletin: (NOTE: - I was unable to find the actual bulletin, but the following is an excerpt from it, which was copied into the forum link I provided above. Scroll down to entry #3 to find the bulletin in it's entirety.) Aggressive Driving High Speed or High RPM Driving Aggressive driving and/or continuous driving at high speeds/high RPMs will increase oil consumption. Because this may not always be an everyday occurrence, it is hard to determine exactly how much the oil economy will be affected. A higher rate of oil consumption is normal for vehicles equipped with manual transmissions that are driven aggressively. By \"aggressive,\" we mean operation at high RPM (3,000 RPM to redline), with frequent use of engine braking (using the engine to slow the vehicle). Vehicles that are driven aggressively may consume engine oil at a rate of up to 0.946 L (1 quart) every 805 km (500 mi). This is normal for a vehicle that is driven aggressively. No repair is necessary. This characteristic does, however, require the owner to check the engine oil level at sufficiently frequent intervals, especially when driving aggressively, to assure the oil level remains within the recommended operating range. As the Owner's Manual recommends, you should check the oil level every time you get fuel. While whether you or I feel this amount of consumption is wrong, GM doesn't seem to think so. It may or may not be a cop-out by GM in not having to fix the engines, but it is what it is. With the bulletin GM is saying to the consumer, live with it. My suggestion to you is to ensure you are keeping up with the oil changes and ensure every time you stop for gas (if not sooner) you are checking the oil to see how much you'll need to add. Buy the oil by the case and call it a day. My 2006 Chevrole",

      "question": "What is the point of changing coolant if it gets constantly replaced?",
      "context": "I drive a 2016 Scion FRS, and based on the maintenance schedule of the coolant: 1st replacement interval is 11 years/137,500 miles (220,000 km). 2nd replacement interval is 6 years/ 75,000 miles (120,000 km) after the 1st. ...I don't really understand the point of replacing the coolant. Why would it need to get replaced if you're constantly replenishing it? Especially during a long period of 11 straight years, wouldn't it have been replaced several times over? Edit #1 I said \"constantly replenishing\". Constant could be any frequency. The definition of constant means occurring continuously over a period of time. So let me be specific, \"topping off when needed\". Also my car is still relatively brand new, under 10k miles. There aren't any signs of leaks that I know of, so it's doubtful I have a leak. I already answered my own question prior to looking at any of the answers here, but correct me if I am wrong. Basically, by \"topping off\", I am diluting the ratio of impurities to non-impurit",
      "answer": "The logic behind replacing the coolant, rather than just topping it off, is to remove impurities. If the reason you have to add to it is that there is a slow leak somewhere, you may get by with just adding some now and then. But if the nature of the problem is that that coolant itself is being depleted, without removing any impurities, then yes, it has to be replaced. What does it look like when you drain it off? Does it look like fresh coolant?",

      "context": "It has now happened twice to me that after adding coolant to the radiator, when I turn the car on the RPM's will bounce up and down and the engine is reving (between 1k and 1.5k RPM's). Normal idle is 750 RPM's. After a while it will eventually idle fine, but usually only after driving it for a bit. Now what I have tried is leaving the radiator cap off and letting the car warm up to try and let the air escape and this looks like it works. The coolant level rises all the way to the top and will eventually 'burp' and go back down. I've let it run for about 20 minutes. But there still seems to be air trapped inside as startups still has rough idling. I have seen some references to a bleeder valve, but my car doesn't seem to have this (2002 Honda Accord). Is there any better way to get the air out?",
      "answer": "Here's a thread from honda-tech.com. Sounds like you should have one from the factory, but it's possible an aftermarket thermostat housing was installed minus the valve. If you really have no bleeder, you could install a thermostat housing that has one, or pull yours and install one yourself. Otherwise, you're on the right track, though you might try running the heater and squeezing the hoses to move air bubbles along. Be careful poking around the engine bay with the engine running, don't lose any fingers. Gentle prods from a rubber mallet might be a safer strategy. You also need to wait for the engine to warm up and for the thermostat to open, otherwise you could have some air trapped in the block with no way out.",

You'll spend as much on other methods as you would buying a Dremel anyway, so the only question is whether your time is worth more than the parts you'll have to replace after ruining them, and the answer is usually yes. Go with the smallest model because it's cheap (well under $50) but still works fine and can get in small places larger tools can't. Metal cutting blades are best, but I was working in a tight space and didn't have a vehicle available to go out and buy any at the time, so I got by using a grinding bit and grinding the whole nut and stud away.",

It should seal up an value leakage. Replacing your AC unit is costly, most leaks can be fixed with a stop leak sealant unless the problem is serious. Save the hose you can reuse it. Look for sales.

Procedure. Screw on the cap and tighten down the gauge, it will poke a hole in the bottle. Attach the hose to the low pressure air conditioning value. There are 2 AC lines, one high, one low pressure. They're both metal. Open the low pressure one and attach the hose well. Start up the car and crank up the AC full blast. Loosen the gauge and let the material flow from the bottle into the AC lines. Agitate the can while it is filling (rotating from the 12 o’clock to 3 o’clock position every few seconds) to help the refrigerant vaporize and get into the system. Don't turn the can upside down; you don't want liquid r134a hitting your compressor. Release the trigger or close the gauge periodically by tightening it down on the bottle. When you do that you can read the pressure in the AC lines. When the pressure is in the safe range, stop! Do not overfill. When the can feels empty (it will feel very light and empty and not as cold as before), you can turn the can upside down to release any remaining refrigerant and oil into the system.",

      "question": "To Use Max AC or AC",
      "context": "If I understand properly, setting your vehicle in the AC setting will cycle air from the outside into your vehicle attempting to cool it before it is pulled in. Likewise, MAX AC only recycles the cabin air not pulling in any air from \"under the hood.\" With that being said, if it is HOT in your car from sitting in a parking lot all day (10+ hours) -- would it get your vehicle cooler if you turn on AC and allow your vehicle to \"cool\" the outside air being pulled in. OR use MAX AC where the HOT cabin air is just cycled throughout your cabin?",
      "answer": "Ok, let's break this down a bit. A/C systems have two basic modes: Outside air Recirculate When you are in outside air mode, the vehicle will allow air from outside the cabin to enter. Recirculate means that the vehicle will mostly use the air already inside of the cabin. Note that both modes allow air to be from both sources. You will get outside air in recirculate, and you will recirculate in outside air. What you change is the amount. The common approach to cooling a hot cabin is to turn on the A/C and let outside air in. This is done to replace the hot inside air with fresh outside air. Once the hot air has been replaced, the recirculate mode is turned on to increase the speed air is cooled inside the cabin. Its easier to cool air that has been recirculating inside the cabin than outside air. Why does MAX A/C work for you? In modern cars, the MAX A/C settings gets an initial burst of outside air in the first few seconds of operation and then starts to recirculate it. It is a hybrid setting that allows you to get cold air as soon as possible. If you car has an intelligent multi mode climate control system then you are going to have to ask the weather guy to help you figure it out. :)",

If vacuum is low or non existent check the check valve for sticking. Also check the vacuum reservoir using a vacuum pump. Leaking on the seams of the reservoir is common.

I've been using this truck mainly for the last year now and have replaced parts as needed. I would really like to get the AC working again. It hasn't been ran in about 7 years now. The heat works fine. The AC had a leak before and needed to be charged to work but the leak was never fixed. What kind of problems can running the AC cause now? Can I just charge it up? Should I at least get it evacuated and charged with a dye first?",
      "answer": "If it was never converted to use R134a instead of R12, you're not just going to be able to charge it up yourself, since something that old probably came from the factory with R12 refrigerant. You need a license to buy R12 in the United States, and it's not cheap. Since your system is compromised and needs attention anyway, you might as well do the R134a conversion if it hasn't already been done. Here is a thread from a C10 forum. Bare minimum for the conversion would be new service ports. At the top end, a new accumulator (receiver/drier), orifice tube, o-rings, compressor and pressure cutoff switch. There is probably a happy medium somewhere in the middle. It's standard procedure to evacuate the system before charging. You probably don't have much to recover, but sucking the system down to a vacuum can tell you how bad your leak is (by how long the system remains holds the vacuum). Since your system has been open for so long, adding some oil when charging is probably a good idea. Especially if you're going to do it yourself, since you'll be running the compressor while charging through the lower pressure port. You'll need to charge the system to find the leaks. A detector wand can pick up refrigerant as it escapes the system. Adding UV dye when charging works, too. You can find the leaks with a UV light. Once you know where the leaks are you can evacuate the system again, fix them, and charge it again and see if you got them all. You can probably do all the work yourself if you have access to the proper equipment to evacuate and charge (vacuum pump setup, gauges and hoses), but you really shouldn't be venting refrigerant to the atmosphere (especially not R12). If you charge it and it leaks out, I guess that's one thing, but a shop would recover it and dispose of it properly.

      "question": "Engine Bogs down with A/C on highway",
      "context": "This started to happen relatively recent. It's 2003 Chevy Trailblazer. What is happening when the engine is idling and I turn the A/C on or the defroster (which also uses the A/C I believe), the engine starts to bog down. What could be causing this extra load on the engine? What could it be in the compressor that is so much resistance? Could it be that I just need to recharge my A/C?",
      "answer": "The compressor is a considerable load on your engine. In order to stop the engine from bogging the A/C usually has a way of raising the idle by letting more air past the throttle body. This function is where I think your problem lies. This can be a separate solenoid specific to the A/C system with a (fairly hefty) vacuum line to both before and after the throttle body. I've seen this solenoid referred to as an A/C Idle Up Vacuum Switching Valve (VSV) in some manuals, but Chevy's terminology may be different. If it is a separate solenoid, there will also be a separate idle-up solenoid for the power steering as well as for large electrical loads (headlamps, large electric fans, rear defroster). You should find this solenoid, verify that it's not working and replace it. The alternative, I guess, is that there is one ECU controlled valve that performs the idle-up function for all the systems that require it. In that case, unless your engine also bogs at other times, I would suspect the electrical pathway that informs the ECU of the compressor operating. Please update your question as you find out more, and I'll add to this answer.",

      "context": "My wife was driving our 96 Ford Windstar recently and she said right after she hit a bump in the road the ac stopped working and the instrument panel lights went out. I found the fuse from the wiring diagram and replaced it bringing the instrument panel back since it's on that circuit. However, every time the ac is turned on, the fuse blows, otherwise it's fine. I did pull the fan belt and the compressor clutch turns freely, so it's not a mechanical issue. My question is, does this always mean it is a short or can a bad switch or relay cause this? Also, what is the best way to track this with a multimeter and ciruit tester or should I invest in another tool for this kind of work? Aftermath: I was able to manually trace the circuit and figured out that there was a cable bundle leading to the a/c cycling switch where the problem was, based on directions from Ben's answer. So I tied it up snug and out of the way using a plastic tie which solved the issue. For now I'm just doing the jerry ",
      "answer": "If the fuse is blowing as soon as you perform an action it's a short to ground. Multimeter won't do much good in this situation. It'll come down to wiring diagrams and visual inspection of the harness and connectors on the circuit. Unless you have a fancy tool that will find the short for you. It looks like fuse 21 powers a bunch of stuff, but since the fuse only blows when you turn the a/c on that narrows it down quite a bit. If you look at an a/c wiring diagram you'll see fuse 21 only powers the blower motors, blend door motor, the constant control relay module and the a/c pressure switches. Try unplugging the low side a/c pressure switch as it's the easiest to access and see if the fuse still blows. You may want to use a circuit breaker while testing. This will tell you if the problem exists south of the switch as I assume the wiring harness will run along the subframe and up to the CCRM. If the fuse stops blowing then it's time to follow the harness to the high pressure switch and from there to the CCM and PCM. Check for rub through, corrosion, obvious breaks in the wire etc...",

      "question": "What happens if I disconnect the battery while the car is running?",
      "context": "There are some comments on the question Are there any modern diesel engines that require electricity to continue running? suggesting that disconnecting the battery while the car is running can damage electrical components. In the 1960's to 1980's alternators had voltage regulators, once the car was running the battery was just a load, like a light bulb. I have memories of needing to drive more cars then we had working batteries for. Put the positive terminal in an insulated container so it does not touch anything and two people drive two cars, with one battery. How could disconnecting it be any more harmful then turn the headlights on or off?",
      "answer": "Removing the battery with the car running is a bad idea. Rather than re-writing something which exists on the interwebz, I pulled this from Troubleshooters.com under the section called Automotive Troubleshooting: Your battery does more than just provide electricity. It also shorts AC spikes and transients to ground. Removing the battery from the circuit allows those spikes and transients to travel around, endangering every semiconductor circuit in your car. The ECU, the speed sensitive steering, the memory seat adjustments, the cruise control, and even the car's stereo. Even if your computers and stereo remain intact, in a great many cases removing the battery burns out the diodes in the alternator, necessitating a new alternator. If disconnecting the battery interferes with the voltage regulator's control voltage input, it's possible for the alternator voltage to go way over the top (I've heard some say hundreds of volts), frying everything. Even the initial premise was wrong. If you disconnect the battery and the car conks out, you don't know if it conked out due to insufficient alternator current, or whether the resulting transients caused your ECU (the car's computer, which controls fuel mixture, timing, and much more) to spit out bad data, shutting down the car. Nobody should EVER run your engine without a battery. And yet when you tell them not to, they'll roll their eyes. \"I'm a professional. I do this every day. It's fine!\" They'll sound so authoritative. So commanding. So in charge. So intimidating. But they're wrong. The problem, of course, is that disconnecting the battery doesn't always damage something. It does it only sometimes. Less experienced jump start professionals and automotive technicians figure if they got away with it a few times, it must be OK.",

Is it because if we remove the plus wire first it may touch the body of the car and close the circuit, causing a short-circuit that leads to ... what? Q2: Why doesn't one get electrocuted when touching the minus wire while removing the battery? I'd image that when touching it we'd be part of the circuit and the current should flow through us. What am I missing here?",
      "answer": "When disconnecting a clamp from a car battery, there is a danger of creating a short circuit with the tools that are in contact with the battery terminal. So a tool in contact with the positive terminal can cause a short circuit if it touches any piece of grounded metal. Starting with the negative terminal removes this danger; now you only need to ensure it does not touch the positive terminal. Once the negative terminal is disconnected, the only way to complete a circuit to the battery is to contact the negative post itself. Nothing else in the entire vehicle would complete the circuit if touched by the tools. So it's now safe to be in contact with the positive terminal and all it is connected to. Electrocution won't happen in any circumstance because the voltage is 12 volts. Even though the battery is capable of supplying many amps, Ohm's law tells us that 12 volts isn't enough to push much current through a person's body.",

The single answer assumes that the OP is referring to a gasoline engine vehicle, but there is a diesel engine options for the vehicle. It has been a while since I last played with any diesel engines, but they used to all have mechanically timed fuel injection, so once you get it running no electrical power is required to keep running. Is this still the case? can you assume that all diesel engines don't require electricity to continue running, or do some now have electronically controlled fuel delivery that is dependent on an intact charging system?",
      "answer": "Most modern diesel engines (ie: engines after mid-80s) require some electricity to run because they are electronically controlled. This is due to computers controlling the fuel charge and monitoring of the engine itself. Without this, the diesel engine has no control. They also require electricity to power the primary fuel pump, to move the fuel from the tank to secondary high pressure pump. (NOTE: A mechanical pump could be used in place of an electrically driven pump, but electric pumps are more common today.) Modern diesel engines can also utilize electronic injectors to meter the fuel being forced into the combustion chamber. So, while it is true, a diesel engine would not require electricity to run, the modern ones do utilize electricity peripherally to maintain better fuel economy and lower emissions.",

      "question": "Can stock headlight wiring deal with 110 W bulbs?",
      "context": "My 2003 Opel Agila has 0.85 mm2 wiring for the entire headlamp circuits. I want to install higher wattage bulbs, up to 110 W. It takes H4 bulbs so the high and low beams are combined into one bulb. I have included the wiring diagram for reference: However, when I googled, I found some stories of the stock wiring melting when using higher powered bulbs. This would obviously be a disaster! As they've used 15 A fuses, I assume the maximum power from each side is 15 A * 12 V = 180 W for each side, so I assume it'd be okay, but I don't really know. Note there is one fuse for each side, so each side can draw 180 W. Will my wiring be able to cope with this sort of power?",
      "answer": "TL;DR: You're on the edge, instead of pushing it, use the existing circuit to control a set of relays and supply the bulbs with a short run of larger wire. Use at least 3.3 mm² (12 AWG) wire, which you can fuse at 20 A. Use wire rated for \"under hood\" (high temperature) applications such as type GXL or TXL. You didn't ask, but I think it worth noting that the traditional means of specifying lamps is by the amount power they consume, not by how effectively they light the road or even by the light output. This almost made sense when there was only one common bulb technology, but it makes no effort to take into account the efficiency of the bulb or the suitability of the bulb for a particular fixture. You may find that your lamp housing aren't designed to run 110 Watt bulbs and that the light pattern produced may be poorly controlled – the result is that you don't get a better picture of the road ahead of you and oncoming drivers get blinded by your lights. Because of that, in the US at least, bulbs above 55 Watts aren't legal. The proper wire for the circuit depends on a number of factors: The expected current in the circuit. The allowable voltage drop (how much voltage will be lost due to resistance in the wire and connections). The total length of the wire run. This includes both the hot and ground wires and is the full path from the battery through the fuse panel to the switch and then to the light and back to ground. The way the wire is routed – if it runs in a bundle with other wires allowance needs to be made for the reduction in cooling that comes from proximity and the heating of the other wires. The expected temperature range where the wire is installed. You can find calculators online that will provide sizing recommendations based on these factors. The one provided by Wire Barn seems good and easy to use. The calculator shows that with a 3 meter (10') run and a 5% voltage drop your existing wiring would be marginally adequate. However, a larger voltage drop ",

The solution is fine for now, but how would I go about tracking down the issue, and why would it drain slow and not immediately if there was a short.",
      "answer": "There a number of possible causes: An old battery that can no longer handle the load of the \"always on\" accessories (clock, alarm, etc.). A new load (like the inverter my son left plugged in) that is draining the battery. A high resistance short that draws enough current to bring down the battery, but not enough to blow a fuse – a \"short\" is any path that short circuits the expected flow of current, they don't have to blow fuses. A failed or failing component may be drawing more current that usual or preventing a load from turning off. Here's how to troubleshoot: Check for any obvious loads. Look for accessories plugged into 12 V outlets, trunk or glovebox lights left on, audio gear that doesn't automatically switch off, etc. Verify that the battery is good (less than five years old, starter is cranks well and the car starts quickly – or have it tested, many auto parts stores will do this for you). Check the top of the battery, if the top is dirty and especially if it is dirty and damp, there may be a high resistance path across the top of the battery. Clean it if in doubt. I don't think this is the problem in your case because the disconnect switch wouldn't prevent this one from discharging your battery. But in the general case this is the next thing to check. Measure the draw on the battery when everything is (supposedly) off. Do this with an ammeter by disconnecting a battery terminal and reading between the terminal and the post on the battery. There shouldn't be more than a few tens of milliamps – anything approaching 100 would be very suspect. If the draw is low, that points back to a bad battery. Have it tested even if you think it is good. Assuming that you found a significant draw, the first thing I'd do is check again for anything that could be on when you think it's off (dome lights?). Then using the ammeter pull each fuse in turn and read with the meter across the fuse terminals. That will show you the load on all of the fused circuits. Keep track of the",

What is more likely is that water getting into/onto the high voltage part of the ignition circuit has caused a spike or surge to be sent through the low voltage circuit, which will fry rectifiers and other solid state components. With that in mind, check to see that the ignition circuitry is well protected from the elements. If you can find it locally, get a can of silicone water shield and give your system a couple of coats of that.

When drawing a full load continuously for 10 seconds I am having some problems with the output of the horn. It is producing a low sound. When I have used the horn normally with out a full load, then it is working fine. Here are my questions 1. If I have upgraded the coil winding to supply more current or power, will my rectifier be negatively effected by this? 2. Will the battery be damaged or become weak if I have supplied more power to it? 3. I have heard that coil rewinding will change some ignition timing. Is it that true? 4. Do I need to",
      "answer": "Firstly, please add more information: What is to make and model of you bike? What are the exact modifications you've done (with spec of the components)? Now, when you say \"under full load\" I assume that you mean with all optional electrical system on and at full settings (like with the high beam on). If that's what you mean, then your horn will function quietly/low because another part of the system is drawing too much amperage and your horn, therefore, can't get the energy it needs to fully function. Now consider, if your old headlight was AC, and you used a rectifier to make the new on DC, then rectifier is adding new resistance, and thus amp draw, of that line. Now also you've upped your headlight from 35w/35w (2.9A/2.9A) to 60w/55w (5A/4.6A). So just based on the new lamp, you're drawing 9.6A on the headlight alone! That's a lot more that the 5.8A that was factory. So, for your questions: If I have upgraded the coil winding, to supply more current/power, then whether, my Rectifier can withstand? This depends on the specs of your rectifier. Battery will damage/become weak if I have supplied more power to it? Modifying your recharge system could severely damage your battery if not done correctly, and could risk causing a battery explosion. Minimally, it's likely to reduce the life of the battery somewhat. The reason the stock system will be lower amperage than the battery is to have more of a \"trickle\" effect. This is a better way to recharge in terms of health. Allowing too rapid a charge (I.e. Higher amperage) will cause the battery to get hotter. In many cases this won't be an issue, but when your battery starts to get old this will become increasingly risky as it won't hold full charge and will draw more from your recharge system. And also I have heared that, coil rewinding will change some ignition timing, Is it so? It should not affect timing. The timing is based off of the mechanical action of the motor, so changing electrical items should not affect it at ",

      "question": "Are there any (legal) ways to increase halogen headlight brightness?",
      "context": "My 2003 Opel Agila has H4 combined full and dipped beam headlight bulbs which are completely useless in the dark. It is really hard to see anything on the dipped beam. They do not seem to be very bright, but the garage replaced both sides at the MOT in November for £10 in total (about $14). I don't know which brand bulbs they are, they just seem to be generic. I know they are halogen. I do a lot of night-time driving, so I need my headlights to be bright so I can see, but at the moment the dipped lights seem to be very dim and do not light up very far ahead, even the adjustment knob is at 0, which is at their highest position. I looked into Xenon headlights, but as I have no headlight washers these would be illegal. I also do not want to blind other oncoming drivers, as that is incredibly dangerous and selfish. Are there any legal upgrades that I can do to make my headlights brighter?",
      "answer": "It is possible that the adjustment is not correct, i.e. the lights are still shining too steep down though the knob is set to 0. Though you can test this on your own, shops will do this with more precision. It doesn't cost much and may be for free. DucatiKiller suggests high-power bulbs in his comment. From the legal side (they're for sure illegal in the UK, too), I think the bulbs will never be inspected, but you may still get into trouble. Imagine someone says the crash happened because he was dazzled by your lights... From the technical side, make sure relays and cables can handle the higher current, an the headlight can handle the increased heat from this bulbs. 65W instead of 50W may be OK, but 110W instead of 55W is quite much. But there are also legal brighter bulbs out there like for example Osram Night Breaker. Compared to a generic bulb, they claim to give more than twice the light, 40m wider range and 20% more white light (Now, how to measure that???) This are of course advertisements, and the numbers are suspicious. But to my experience (and many others on the web), they indeed give brighter and more white light. If it's twice the light? Hmmm, not sure, but definitely more. Here is a german blog showing pictures with standard and this bright bulbs. This bulbs are legal and have no technical issues because they have the same power as generic bulbs. But they also have two disadvantages: They are really expensive, and their life time is typically just about 50% of generic bulbs. The reason is, to get more and more white light out of a bulb with same power, the filament must be hotter. But hotter filament drastically decreases life time. Finally, you mentioned Xenon lights. It's not that simple to convert normal lights to Xenon lights. You do not only need headlight washers, you will also need an automatic adjustment, and the headlight must be made for Xenons. There are many illegal conversion sets out there. I guess Xenon is usually only an option if the ca",

      "context": "On a 2003 Saab 9-5 Aero, only the left rear fog light lights up. The right side has a bulb but when I switch the bulbs, the left still is the only side that lights up. I thought it might be a wiring issue, however a friend mentioned that his Porsche only has wiring and bulbs on the left side for the reverse fog light. Is the left side really the only side that should light up for a pair of rear fog lights? (The fact that the right side has a bulb in the Saab seems strange to me, but maybe it was easier to make them symmetric during manufacturing).",
      "answer": "I did some research on some Saab forums. I found that typically on US bound Saab 9-5 a bulb is installed on both sides. However, the metal circuit on the passenger side is cut to disable that side. This is to prevent the rear fog lights from appearing as brake lights (there are arguments about the legality of dual rear fog lights in certain US locations). It appears the circuit can be soldered back together and to enable dual rear fog lights.",

      "answer": "This is very common, and not a problem. When you are starting your car, the load on the battery is huge compared to when the engine is running, as the starter motor is having to turn the crankshaft and push the pistons while the oil is cold and thick, and additionally compressing air into the cylinders, pumping fuel and causing a spark, while also driving belts, fans, alternator etc. As soon as the engine is running, the alternator begins to top the battery back up, but to give an indication of how much the battery is loaded during start up, if your alternator fails, you can drain your battery in only a few attempts, especially in cold weather. It is good practice to have aircon, lights etc. Turned off while starting the car, for this very reason.",

Well, if the voltage that gets to the light bulb is always the same, for more light, the light bulb must have less resistance and the current in consequence will be higher. Question(s) : Will this type of light bulbs damage any part of the wiring? And will their life time be shorter than normal ones? (This might be a silly question)",
      "answer": "If the bulb in question is the same fitment as the original (is just a higher wattage or whatever), then it should cause no issues with the wiring. I believe the main differences can be linked back to what type of gas is used inside the bulb and what filament is used to produce the light. Some are going to be hotter than others, no doubt. Usually, if you look on the back of a pack of bulbs (thinking of Sylvania bulbs), it will tell you how they differ from other bulbs of the same type made by them. Usually I've seen the ones which claim to be brighter show to last less time than OEM style bulbs, but the brightness far outshines the originals. Here is one of the Sylvania charts: You can see on the left side in the product description how long they are supposed to last.

      "answer": "Your description sounds very much like the battery is totally dead and needs replacing. When you jump lead a car, you are replacing the installed battery with the one from the other car for starting the engine. Once the engine is running, all the cars electrical functions will be running from electricity generated by the alternator. At this point, a healthy battery will charge from the alternator and will be ready to start the engine next time. Your battery sounds like it is not accepting a charge and is therefor useless and needs replacing. The only thing that confuses this is that you say you had the battery tested. How long ago did you test it and how was the test performed? If the battery is truly in good order, then can you tell me where you connected the jump leads to on you car, did you connect them directly to the battery?",

This worked fine for a week or so, but I'm now at the problem where I'm experiencing loss of electrical power - car sounds uncertain about starting, clock is reset etc. There's still some power, because the radio, lights and clock etc still operate, even if the car doesn't start.

      "answer": "The fault you describe appears to be a simple matter of 'parasitic drain' on the battery. Disconnect the battery earth terminal, connect a ampmeter between the cable and the battery post. Run the ampmeter to outside of the bonnet and close the bonnet without trapping the ampmeter wires. Make sure all doors are closed, they do not have to be locked. After about 10 minutes, check the amp reading. After around ten minutes all modules will go to 'sleep'. The ampmeter reading should now be at about 0.03 amps to 0.5 amp max. The doors must be closed as opening the doors activates the initial operation of the fuel pump, the bonnet being open activates isolation of the windscreen wipers. Both of these mean the vehicle will not go to sleep. If the ampmeter shows a high reading, you must now systematically disconnect circuits until the amps drop off. One way is to disconnect one fuse at a time, check the ampmeter. If it has now dropped, that is the circuit that is causing the drain. Rectify as necessary. If the amps do not drop replace the fuse and then disconnect the next fuse. Repeat the procedure to find the drain. If you have none standard accessories, such as amplifiers, the disconnecting routine should start with these. Finally, even if a battery or a replacement alternator are new there is an outside chance that they may be defective and this should be borne in mind.",

Perhaps if I'd have visually inspected the alternator I might have seen a crack, but the alternator is not visually accessible anyways. 3) Mitsubishi Eclipse - Aftermarket voltage gauge installed, noted that at idle the voltage was down at battery type levels (12.3 instead of 13-14). Took that as my warning and swapped the alternator. Factory gauge/light gave no warning. 4) Mitsubishi Eclipse - Voltage regulator in the above replacement alternator failed after 9 months (still in warranty, but was unable to get the aftermarket manufacturer to honor the warranty, I now ONLY buy OEM alternators). Voltage was running too high (15-16 volts). Noticed that every single warning light on the dash would glow... So, perhaps that might be a warning to keep in mind for overvoltage failures. :-)",

      "answer": "As your father says, car batteries are designed for a burst of power (the high-current starter motor), not a steady stream. If you're going to use a battery a a general power supply, you need to get a \"deep-discharge\" battery, as designed for caravans/marine etc usage. Constantly discharging/charging a normal car battery will reduce it's life significantly, so it is best avoided where possible. The time taken to recharge the battery depends on the size of the battery and the size of your alternator, but it will take a lot longer at idle than in normal driving - car alternators are designed to give peak output at normal cruising revs (usually around 3,000rpm). A proper generator will have an engine designed to run at a certain speed, and a generator matched to that speed, so that it is constantly running at peak efficiency.",

Some background: I just moved to texas where they require vehicle inspections. My horn doesn't work, a spring in the steering collumn needs to be replaced, and they want to charge $640 for it. Since my car has 200,000 miles on it, and i have had some experience with soldering and circuitry i want to wire it up myself. has anyone done anything like this before? It is a '93 Mazda Protege Thanks!",
      "answer": "First off I can say that I have done something like this, but with the ignition and not the horn - my friends ignition switch broke so we wired a bright red push button directly from the battery (well - actually a fused 12v line inside the car) to the starter motor coil - it has since worked like a champ for nearly two years. First off - DO NOT wire directly from the battery, there is always a potential for a short (say in an accident or due to your own mistake) and those lead-acid batteries can be unpleasant when they explode. Nothing will ruin your day than having a car fire after your accident, use an inline fuse at least, using the cars existing fuse/breaker system would be better (i.e. use an existing 12v line) Your best bet would be to splice the 12v from the accessory 12v line in the harness (it should be exposed near your radio) Since this is fused and isolated from any more important components. TYPICALLY the horn is on its own branch, just because it needs to be activated by the alarm system and should be able to honk when the key is out (the accessory 12v is usually shut off when the key is taken out), however this may not be important to you. The proper way would be to look up the wiring diagram in your car and find which wire in the harness corresponds to the horn 12v supply (it may be tied to some other 12v line - like internal illumination) and which wire corresponds to the horn, -tie the two together with a switch and you are good to go. The \"stupid college student way\" (I only say this because this is what we did with my friends ignition) to approach the problem would be to pull a wire through the firewall and directly to the horn, tied to some random 12v line near the dash. As for placing the switch... I would avoid opening up the steering wheel, but thats just my squeemishness around airbag systems, although I don't know if your car has a driver airbag so it may be clear.

On my dashboard, there is a small screen that has been displaying \"CHECK CHARGE SYSTEM\" and displaying warning lights (TPMS, power steering, and stability control). I took it in to a mechanic and they diagnosed it as a bad alternator that isn't charging the battery fully. The alternator itself sounds fine (still quiet) and only has 50k miles on it, so I believe the bearings and the internals are still good. Can I just change the regulator in this instance? When should you swap the regulator versus swapping the entire alternator?",
      "answer": "This sounds like a regulator fault. I sell these alternators daily, and we cannot get the regulator as a spare part (well, not here in NZ, anyway). The alternator has a feedback terminal to the ECU. If it does it again, give the alternator connector a clean and see if it goes away. If it does, the issue is a loose connection. If it doesn't, then the issue is internal and you're up for a new unit. The reason the other lights come on, is that the ECU recognizes that these items may fail if the battery is not fully charged. As the report is not coming back from the alternator to say that it is charged, the ECU flags a fault on those items as well. Of course, the above assumes that the battery is in good condition. As the car is less than a year old, it would be pretty odd if the battery is faulty. A proper load test and off-vehicle charge should clear the battery of guilt. When should you swap the regulator versus swapping the entire alternator? When you know what has damaged the regulator in the first place and it has been fixed. If, for instance, the rotor has a short circuit and is drawing too high a current, the new regulator will fail also. When it is a major job to extract the alternator for repair. If it's a 3 hour workshop job to get the unit out, you don't want to do that twice. I believe the Honda is not that hard, so it's really a call to be made from your wallet ;)",

      "question": "Diode selection or &quot;Engine Running Only&quot; electrical source on 1965 Mustang?",
      "context": "I am working with a 1965 mustang and have added heated seats. The seat heater wiring does not have a latching circuit and is controlled by a SPDT Hi/off/Low switch. In an effort to only allow the seats to be powered when the engine is running, I've added a relay to the control wiring that will have a fused direct battery feed for the heat load and \"running only\" source for the relay coil. I thought of using the feed off of the alternator \"BAT\" output. My problem is that this wire is terminated at the hot side of the starter relay with the positive battery feed, so the coil would be always energized. To isolate the battery from the Alternator output I was thinking of adding a diode. Not being sure of the alternator currents, I do not know how to accurately size this diode, an I am concerned about the heat it would generate. Is there maybe a better TAP that I can use for this? Maybe the \"fld\" or \"sta\" from the alternator or something off of the voltage regulator that would be a better?",
      "answer": "I have two solutions for you, depending on your skill level. The first is using a zener diode to turn on the relay once the voltage is above 12.6 volts. This will energize the relay anytime the battery voltage is above 12.6 volts. You could go as high as 13 volts, but that might turn the relay off under high electrical loads with the engine running. The 12 volt battery in the car tops off at 12.6 volts, so other than a surface charge the only time the voltage will be higher than that is when the alternator is running. I might would start off with a breakdown voltage of 12.8 and see how that works out for you. Option two is to go with a commercial solution. Lind electronics make several shut down timers that you may like. The T2 Shut down timer turns off after a preset time or voltage. They have several other models you may like as well.",

I found this helpful list of places to lube: What brake components need to be lubricated? but it does not mention what type of lubes to use. On my car, the manual says to use silicone grease on the pins. After reading around online, it seems like every synthetic grease I find has stories about rubber bits swelling. Is the general consensus to use real silicone on the slider pins? Also, anything metal to metal seems more lenient. Moly is popular, and some people use anti-sieze. I saw warnings against anti-seize getting dusty, and nothing really against moly. Is something with molybdenum generally recommended?",
      "answer": "Two lubes are needed to properly lubricate caliper type brakes. Silicone is used on the slider pins and anything that touches rubber. A generous amount that completely coats the pin, hole wall and rubber expansion boot is needed. Be sure to coat the boot lips that fit in the grooves that hold them in place, this act as a sealant. This lube will not swell rubber parts and does not dissolve in water. A different, grease based, lubricant is used on all parts of the brake pad that touch the caliper. A thin even coat is applied to the pad ends and backing side in the areas where the piston or caliper body touch the pads. It is also advised to apply to apply a thin coat the shims on the caliper bracket where the pads ends will slide. This has two purposes. It allows the pads to move freely in the bracket which reduces both wear and noise. It also inhibits corrosion which can cause the pads to bind thus increasing noise and wear. We use this product; others are available. It must be a high temperature tolerant formula. Pad lubrication is often omitted to the detriment of brake life.",

Stepping on the brake pedal moves a rod that pushes brake fluid to the wheels. If a seal is failing it may allow brake fluid to seep by it reducing the fluid pressure to the wheels. As an aside if you have it replaced you may be able shift the blame to mechanical failure instead of operator error. It may help avoid a insurance increase or traffic citation.",

When it happens, the 'Low Trak' light also comes on. So, it would be a 'Yeah, so?' thing, except it didn't happen before, and, I don't see this winter's driving as any different than prior years. Tires are not new, but more than legal; I would say tread is about 'normal' for us - so, again, not markedly different than prior years. I also swapped them (front <-> rear), which didn't change anything. Suspension is OK, AFACT, though the rear struts are old. In any case, the fault doesn't correlate with bouncing or such. Edit (OP): The ABS (always, I think) works normally, and doesn't fault, when the brakes are applied. The fault occurs when there's slip under torque. Even, pretty minimal torque. I don't know if it happens every time there's slip. It seems unlikely, but I can't rule it out. Q: Why the change? Bonus Q",

If it was a wheel bearing or sensor that was at fault, I would expect occasional false activation of the ABS and also normal activation where the pedal judders. It looks instead like the ABS ECU is detecting the wheel locking, then it tries to activate the ABS, but either the ABS valve body or the possible the pump mechanism is not working correctly and so the ABS fails.",

      "context": "I have a problem with my handbrake (bear with me now). So I went to the service to have them check it out. The mechanic took a 10 second look at my car and told me I needed to change both of my brake discs along with everything related to the handbrake. Now let me be clear. I've never had any problems with my brakes. They work surprisingly well for my 15 year old car. I don't know when the brake discs were last changed but I've never had any issues with braking. But I do have issues with my handbrake and I'm prepared to pay for the fix. I just don't see how it is necessary to change the brake discs on the front wheels (which I assume are only used for normal braking). It seems like overkill. Are the two braking systems mechanically dependent on each other so much that it would require me to completely revamp both of them or is the mechanic just padding the bill? Is there any way I can assess the brake discs myself to make sure I'm not being conned? My car is a Fiat Punto 2001 Sporting.",
      "answer": "So here's what I've learned in the past couple of days. Apparently there is a simple way of assessing the condition of brake discs/rotors. For every car there is a minimum thickness for the brake discs. Once they get below that thickness it's safe to say that they're past their lifetime. For my specific model (Fiat Punto 2001 Sporting) that thickness is 10.2mm. I found this info in a Haynes manual for the vehicle. It's not too hard to find the same info for any other car. The car braking fine is not a good indicator of the condition of the brake discs since it's quite possible to use them and the brake pads until their very physical end without noticeable issues. Example: There are many videos on YouTube that explain how one can accurately measure the thickness of their brake discs. Checking the thickness is not the only way to assess the condition of a brake disc but it is the easiest and most indicative assessment approach for a rookie. Mine were indeed below their minimum thickness.",

This time I took it to my trusted brake shop, and they ended up diagnosing a bad ABS unit. Could this have been the problem all along and just changing the calipers released enough pressure that I got along with softer-than-necessary brakes for a few weeks? Possibly. Hard to say. Just wanted to add more info here in case anyone discovers this in the future with the same issue. Check (or have your shop check) your ABS unit too. Original Answer: Well, @paulster2 gets it right again. 2 bad calipers in a row. Got a different caliper from another parts store and put it on and it is working great today. My ultimate diagnostic test in determining that it had to be a faulty caliper was this: Once I drove the truck around and got the brake nice and tight, I jacked it up, pulled the wheel off, and opened the bleeder valve. a small amount of fluid came up but not very much and the caliper was still tight. I had read about this troubleshooting technique but I kept trying to figure out things further up in the brake system. But ultimately I realized that any pressure further up in the line, no matter the source, could be relieved at the bleeder. So I did the bleeder test and even pulled the caliper back and forth with the rotor loose and it never released (but the new slide pins allowed the caliper to move beautifully). I even took off the supply line with the intention of replacing the caliper and then tried it again (so nothing was connected to it) and still frozen. Bad caliper. Lesson 1: Buy RockAuto or Napa. Lesson 2: Don't trust the probabilities. Trust the facts :-)",

Once you ensure all of the air is out of your brake lines you may find it's resolved. If not, you will need to troubleshoot from there. The benefit is that you will know it's not air in your lines which is the first thing to rule out if you don't have obvious leaks observable from visual inspection. The device below is a brake fluid vacuum. They vary in cost. You attach the device to the bleeding nipple on your caliper and create a vacuum in the line that draws the fluid out.

The pressure feedback from my brake pedal progressively increases as I apply more force to it, but I'm able to push it until it feels like it is stopped by a physical barrier (with engine running and while stopped). The pedal maintains constant travel distance with constant pressure from my foot. The bite seems good. I only needed to press it down a couple inches (well before hitting the physical barrier) to get maximum braking during a few 50-10 mph tests. I've also flushed the brake fluid and it is the same. Is this amount of pedal travel normal?",
      "answer": "First of all, if you worried about brakes have a proffesional check them out. That said, I've had the same problem after replacing pads before. Jumped in the car and pressed the pedal down hard, thinking I was simulating a hard braking situation. I was convinced that the pedal didn't normally do that, but the reality is that in a normal driving situation, you are not pushing on the pedal that hard. Most of the time, you apply pressure to the brakes until it is obvious you are slowing down, and this point is (hopefully) well before the floor or end of petal travel. This does not take a lot of force, or certainly less force then most people actively realise. You said yourself: I only needed to press it down a couple inches (well before hitting the physical barrier) to get maximum braking during a few 50-10 mph tests. Since this isn't a daily driver, start your daily up, and push the pedal all the way in. I haven't driven a car yet where you can't \"bottom out\" the pedal-- when stopped with engine running/brake booster engaging. I wasn't convinced this was normal until I test drove a brand new (12 miles) car, and was able to push the pedal all the way down.

Also I can feel a slight pulsating when I brake at around 15-25mph. Any ideas of what I should be looking for? UPDATE: I finally got sick of the noise and replaced the brake drum, problem solved.",

If you really wanted to try to reproduce it, you could try doing that again. but I would suggest doing it in a safe place, like driving around a parking lot for a whiiilee.... I drove around the corner to where I was going with the e-brake, and parked it. The car sat for maybe a half an hour. When I came out to start it and try it again, everything worked fine. I have been trying to see if I can get them to fail for the last couple days and everything seems fine. Sounds like a heat-related issue... or at least affected by it. If it is, then driving it a lot and braking more should cause it to happen again, although I don't recommend you driving it around much at all in this condition. The brake fluid was at an acceptable level as well. What color is the fluid? How old? Could be that the fluid is so old and full of contaminants that when heated, it became very very compressible. although probably not that likely to be or behave THAT bad. How much braking did you do during that driving around before the problem occurred? Were you braking hard at any point? How much time lapsed since going into the store and getting out to start to car with everything working again? How are the pads, rotors, etc.? When was the last time you had them serviced? How was the fluid level while the problem was occurring? When did you last change fluids? If you are feeling gung-ho about it then I would suggest starting by changing fluids; and if you really want to start replacing parts, replace the brake cylinders, unless those parts are relatively new. If you do not normally work on cars or are not comfortable with working on the brake system, I strongly suggest taking it to a mechanic for proper diagnosis and repair. Brakes are super safety critical for obvious reasons. ABS system is a good thing to check, as mentioned by someone. Calipers too, as mentioned by someone, ",

      "question": "Does an increase in horsepower allow a greater speed in any given gear?",
      "context": "I wasn't sure if this was the best place to post this, or if I should go post it in the physics stackexchange as well. I can crosspost if this question would be more fitting over there. To put this question in context, take my car for example. Before winter, I had installed an aftermarket air intake, which claims to increase the power output by about 4 or 5 horsepower. I noticed that when I redlined in 3rd gear and shifted into 4th, I was consistently at 93 or 94 mph. I recently swapped the intake back to the stock intake, and since then, I have been consistently leaving 3rd gear at 90 or 91 mph - and that's redlining through all gears. A few of my friends attribute this to user error, in that I am evidently not shifting as efficiently as I was whenever I had the aftermarket intake. Some of my other friends argue that these 2 or 3 extra mph in 3rd gear could have come from the extra 4 or 5 horsepower that the intake gave me. Is this feasible? I am essentially just wondering if it is po",
      "answer": "Summarized Answer No, HP does not determine MPH in a gear, the gear ratio does. Although there are hypothetical ways that HP can seem to make the vehicle go faster in the same gear, it doesn't actually change the speed capacity of that gear as long as the engine RPM is limited. Expanded Answer As noted, the answer is no... or at least not really. In lower gears, the gear becomes the limiting factor because there's only so many RPM that the engine can perform. In higher gears, the engine does become the limiting factor because the gears allow sufficient feedback and resistance to the engine that it can't keep pushing. As an example: Say your in a gear with a 2:1 ratio and you're traveling 60 MPH. At this point, we can say you're getting 'x' amount of resistance from wind, but with the 2:1 ratio, only 1/2'x' is making it to the engine in the form of resistance. If you shifted gears into a 1:1 gear, then the engine would be fighting a full 'x' of resistance. This is why if you have a very open, high-speed gear (like most cars' final drive gear) your engine doesn't (typically) produce enough power to totally overcome the various resistances that are in play. The clearest example of this is when you're driving up a steep hill in 3rd and you notice how much sluggishness there is. When you down-shift, suddenly you can accelerate much better. This is because in the lower gear more power is being used as torque and therefore less resistance is transmitted to the motor and your engine can now overcome that resistance. You engine didn't get stronger by down-shifting, but the way that the power is being applied did change. If you're more interested in understanding a lot of the physics that are involved in translating a car's power to its speed, check out this \"Advanced\" article. I do stress that it's actually \"advanced\" meaning that if you're not up on physics and the maths, this may be pretty confusing.

If I hold the clutch down for too long, it's impossible to shift into gear. Either there will be resistance from the shifter making it difficult to shift into first / reverse, or if I am able to shift without resistance (most of the time), I can't actually engage and drive the car without immediately stalling. This problem goes away if I simply let off the clutch then press it back in and promptly shift and engage as normal.

For driving one, I find that having an rough idea about what the gearbox, engine and clutch do and where they are is often enough. However for the life of me I can't figure out one thing. You know when you want to get the car moving again from a complete stop, you raise the clutch to the biting point, release the brake and start to accelerate? As the clutch gets to the biting point yet before the car is able to move, for the wheels are kept still by the brake, the front of the car lifts up. What is lifting the front of the car up? Surely if the wheels are not actually rotating, inertia isn't the cause. What's at work here? Cheers. If you object to the question enough to downvote it, why not explain yourself and suggest ways to improve it?",
      "answer": "The reason why the car lifts even if its stationery is because of the torque produced by the engine and the suspension. The engine is not connected to the wheels with one single shaft, there is the transmission in between which will have a very minute slack in the gearings. So when you let go of the clutch the torque from the engine tries to push the car forward now to things happen here. Assuming the wheels are braked in. In the minute slack in the various parts of the transmission the engine gets a very small space to move. The engine tries to move the tyres but it cant since they are braked in. SO obviously the only other thing which can move are the suspension which have a little bit of flex. All this combined lifts the car up basically due to the torque of the engine and the flexibility of the suspension.",

I have to rock it back and forth and shift up and down the gears a for a while before it shifts. I have changed the gear oil (it was very dark and had a lot of metal flakes in it). What could be the problem?",
      "answer": "There are a few possibilities, especially with the smaller Suzuki shift drums such as yours as well as the innate way in which constant mesh transmissions work. The detente at the end of the pawl lifter on the cam driven gear that the shifting shaft acts upon could be getting stuck as it's old and worn out. The pin costs $2.95 and is worth replacing. As well, the spring that provides force against the gear shifting cam could be worn is also only $2.95 The clutch could be dragging just a bit making it difficult to shift into neutral. This is very common. Ensure your clutch is adjusted properly by taking up the slack and giving the lever about 2-3mm of play when the handlebars are turned all the way to the left and right which changes play in the cable. If the bike is turned off and it is difficult to get it into neutral, push the bike forward and backward which will rotate the secondary shaft in the transmission and allow the dogs and slots on the shafts to line up in order to get into or out of a gear. The cam on the shift drum could be worn rather than the pawl. Inspect the cam for a detente that the pawl has created where it might get stuck on the cam driven gear.

What is the difference between coasting and being towed?",
      "answer": "All wheel drive vehicles connect the front and rear axles via a transfer case or differential. While on a wheel lift tow one set is lifted off the ground and not spinning and the trailing wheels are spinning at road speed. This places a big load and resulting wear on the power transfer unit. Coasting allows all four wheel to spin at road speed but with no engine power applied. I guess you could tow it with an older type of tow rig that used a frame sling lift. The raised wheels could spin freely. Modern vehicles with plastic bumpers wouldn't fair well with this older hoist technology, Which is why wheel lift has become the new standard. It is being replaced by flat/tilt bed rigs due to the increased number of all wheel drive vehicles available.",

      "context": "My 2010 Silverado 1500 (500,000 km) has a problem with the transmission. It maks s clunking noise when shifting from second to third gear. I've been driving around it by letting off the gas when it shifts from second to third. The clunking isn't nearly as bad when I do that. Question: The noise has been getting slightly worse over the year that I’ve owned the truck. It will inevitably get much worse over time. What will happen when the transmission eventually fails? For example, would it give me lots of warning (loud noise) when accelerating at low speeds? Or is there a high-risk safety issue, when driving at highway speeds? Notes: My mechanic noted that the truck struggles to get from 2nd to 3rd gear (revs up to 3000 RPMs), which indicates that it's a problem with the transmission, not a U-joint. He says the U-joints look fine. He doesn't recommend servicing the transmission (changing the transmission fluid) since that could do more harm than good at this mileage (500,000 km). The tra",
      "answer": "More than likely, when the transmissions goes, it will just quit working. It may exhibit some noise when it gives up the ghost, but that isn't a given. The transmission in your truck is the 6L80E (six-speed ... if that's wrong, correct me). The major weak part of these transmissions is said to be the torque converter. These are known to expire and cause issues. Considering the amount of mileage on your truck, you've done pretty good with it. The \"usual\" time with the TC expires is before 150k miles (~250,000KM), if the TC is actually your issue. It is my understanding, unfortunately, that when the TC is going (or has gone out), it does so in spectacular form, which means a complete rebuild or replacement of the transmission. Is it a safety issue? Usually not. About the only time where it might be is if it finally goes while heading uphill with zero momentum. There'd about be no way to get the truck to the side of the road without letting it roll backwards. Replacement is probably your only option. That will need to happen at some point. A cheaper alternative may be to purchase a used transmission. The only problem with it is how long will it last. Getting one would be far cheaper than a rebuilt/new one. Either way with a new, rebuilt, or used transmission, you'll want to ensure you get a new torque converter to install with it.",

Sometimes it might “crawl” to the center, but not usually.

Is this normal behavior (i.e. different cars act differently) and how complicated is it to add or restore this spring action?",
      "answer": "Its going to be one of 3 things, its either the shifter bushings, needs an adjustment, or the return springs are worn out. All of those are fairly easy. When you put it in gear is there a lot of movement or does it feel stiff? if it's not stiff then you need bushings. When its in neutral does it feel springy when you move it side to side? if not you need to replace the springs-from what i've read i think this is your problem. Hopefully the linkages on your tranny aren't buried, if they are not then no worries it'll be real easy.

      "context": "I see in some city car reviews, like the Citroen C1, that they have something called \"Long Gearing\". What is Long Gearing? What are the implications of it?",
      "answer": "Long/short gearing basically refers to what the transmission is designed to do and at what RPM you want your vehicle to run at a given speed. Short gearing refers to having the gear ratios closer together so as to have faster shifts and get to speed quicker while using a minimal amount of torque to get you there. The trade-off is you have a slower top speed. In smaller, fuel efficient vehicles, this is less important because you usually don't drive them at 120mph down the autobahn. Long gearing refers to having the gear ratios spread further apart, with the final drive (usually an overdrive) allowing for a higher top speed with less engine RPM. This gives you better fuel mileage in the long run at the trade off of usually having a slower take-off speed. This is the type of gearing you want if you are running the vehicle down the highway all the time. Usually, both the final drive gearing and the differential gearing together will indicate whether a vehicle is long or short geared. There really isn't a magic number saying if your final drive is above 3.4:1 final drive you are running a long geared transmission (Note: I just threw that number out there, lol.) It's a matter of one transmission/differential gearing being longer or shorter than another.",

Will the gearbox casing fit in the transmission tunnel? Will the gearbox effect the underbody position of things like the exhaust system or fuel tank? Will the gearbox cross member accept the new gearbox mountings? Will the propshaft alignment be in alignment? Will the propshaft connect to the gearbox and allow a sliding joint? Will the propshaft length now be too long or too short to connect to the differencial? When your vehicle was first built it was with its present configuration.

      "question": "What determines when an automatic transmission shifts?",
      "context": "I'm working on developing an automatic bicycle (mostly microcontroller based) and I'd presume I'd be shifting in a similar way to a car. So my question is, what factors does the transmission take into consideration when shifting? I know when I drive my car, it tries to shift at a constant engine rpm, but when I accelerate fast, say when entering the highway on a short entrance ramp, the tranny doesn't exactly keep up with the engine rmp, which may be at 5 or 60000 rpm before shifting. So is it concerned more with speed, rpm, some other factors,or all of them? Which ones take precedence in its decision to shift? So for instance, my main concern is riding the bike downhill. Now if you're riding a regular bike like me, you would stop pedaling and let gravity do the work for you. Does an automatic transmission do this as well or does it shift up to match the speed or down to match the low rpm?",
      "answer": "I'm working on developing an automatic bicycle (mostly microcontroller based) and I'd presume I'd be shifting in a similar way to a car. Well, you're in for a shock: it's going to be pretty different. So my question is, what factors does the transmission take into consideration when shifting? ... So is it concerned more with speed, rpm, some other factors,or all of them? Which ones take precedence in its decision to shift? It depends. The ruleset is going to be situation dependent and somewhat non-deterministic (also known as using fuzzy logic). A car ruleset is also going to be very different from one that you'd use on a bicycle. Here are some examples of the conflicting priorities that you face in a car's automatic transmission: Fuel economy Acceleration Throttle response (is there a shifting delay between stomping on the gas and feeling the go?) Fuel economy (what, again?) Annoyance (oscillating shifting is annoying: e.g., 3-4-3-4-3-4). Fuel economy (yes, yes, we get it!) The point being, the transmission is trying to optimize a bunch of conflicting metrics looking for a local maxima. So for instance, my main concern is riding the bike downhill. Now if you're riding a regular bike like me, you would stop pedaling and let gravity do the work for you. Does an automatic transmission do this as well or does it shift up to match the speed or down to match the low rpm? On a bicycle, you have a complete different set of problems. For example, I like to pedal at a fixed pace and I'll fiddle with the gears regularly to match my road speed to my pedaling pace. Your automatic transmission would need to gear up and down according to road speed. It would also need to anticipate the upcoming hill - I do, since I can see the slope and gear down. Waiting until my pace slows down will be annoying. It would be better to detect the situation (e.g., using a level or GPS data). On a downhill slope, I gear up so that I can build up momentum. I also like knowing that I'm in the right g",

But a lot lighter than that varying in amplitude (louder and lower) and probably is only there when the engine is cold (Because I don't seem to observe it after I have driven a few miles). How I confirmed? On neutral gear, I paddled the gas the sound goes louder but when I press the clutch and then paddle there is no sound. So does it call for a gear box repair? PS: and yes I could observe this back when I used to turn the A/C on, back then the sound was very low and when I would press the clutch it would disappear. If this is a gear box repair thing can I delay it? or it would cause nine stitches later on?",
      "answer": "If the sound goes away when the clutch is depressed then the sound is coming from the rotating internals of the gearbox, depressing the clutch will allow them to come to a stop (bear in mind that it's a constant-mesh box, so if the clutch is up then the internals spin even in neutral when the car is stationary) The best diagnosis is to drain the gearbox oil, it should be clear and a light caramel colour, if there is evidence of metal filings then the box is worn or worse. This is also a good opportunity to refresh the oil and make sure that the oil level is correct, which can both have a positive effect on gearbox performance, life and noise. It looks as though you're concerned about cost, and oil change is inexpensive compared to the cost of gearbox repair, especially if you can do it yourself.",

It warns you of situations where you might need to change your oil earlier than the scheduled time, which saves you money because it can prevent engine damage due to \"used\" oil that needs to be changed.

      "context": "I have found a relevant quote from here that might be related: Plugged-in engines are already half-warmed when started. Fuel consumption is thus reduced by an average of 15 per cent over the first 20 kilometers driven (after which, the engine will be fully warm) according to the CAA. I know also that all fluids become more viscous as temperature decreases, and so the engine oil becomes thicker and requires more fuel to pump it around when it is cold. The battery also experiences a higher strain due to the increased current draw from the starter motor when the driver tries to start the car in the cold (they perform a cold start). What is meant if an engine is \"plugged in\"? Note: This question applies to non-electric cars.",
      "answer": "In very cold climates there are electric heaters that replace the dip stick. They are plugged into an AC outlet and because they reach the oil pan they can apply heat directly to the oil. That way the oil doesn't get cold to the point where it totally looses it's ability to keep your engine protected at start up. It's plugging in that electric heater that \"plugging-in\" refers to. In places like North Dakota parking lots have electric outlets for each spot just for this. Hope that helps!",

I would suggest that the driveshaft oil seals (where the shafts leave the gearbox) is a likely suspect. Where is the oil filter mounted? The seals around them can often be suspect. Another possibility is that the oil is leaking most or all of the time, but is pooling on something under the engine (such as the plastic undertray often fitted to cars of that age), then running off when the car is parked facing uphill. I'm afraid the best way to tell is by getting dirty! If you have access to jacks and stands, park on solid, level ground and jack the front of the car.

      "context": "I'm curious: When I pour oil into the engine via the oil fill port that my oil filler cap seals off where does all that oil go initially? What parts get first dibs on the oil before gravity pulls it down to the pan. Are the oil filler ports always on the top of the engine? Is there any particular reason other than maybe ease of access as well as avoiding spills and leaks, basically trying to maximally distance the port from the oil settling line?",
      "answer": "Most car engines have the oil filler at the top in the valve cover. It does not need to be here and I am sure there are some strange engine designs that have the fill plug in bizarre spots. Most racecars have a separate tank that gets filled and there isn't any hole in the valve covers. For most cars the valve cover is simply a very convenient easy to reach area and so they put the fill port there. The oil really doesn't do much oiling as you pour it in but some will sit on a small portion of the cam(s) and valvetrain, but not enough to do anything. Most will flow right down to the bottom. The way the oil is actually used is it is forced through the oil pump and gets pressurized. this pressure creates a barrier for the bearings on the crankshaft and connecting rods. surprisingly little of the oil gets fed to the valves and valvetrain. In fact with many older engines the valve train was greased or oiled by hand and were exposed without a cover at all, the cam would still get oil and be somewhere inside the block. the cams main journals do get pressurized oil to keep it spinning without touching the bushings it rides in. As the engine runs it will also splash some oil onto the cylinder walls most of this oil will get scraped off by the piston to keep it from getting into the combustion chambers. The scraping happens very quickly and blasts the oil through drain holes in pistons skirt to the center of the piston. This oil spray from the \"scavenged\" oil is used to oil the wrist pins. Some high power / performance engines use some of the high pressure oil in conjunction with the oil spray to oil their wrist pin. The image below shows the forces exerted on the crankshaft and what the oil pressure actually does to keep it from touching the anything. The white circle is representing the crankshaft, specifically a journal of the crankshaft. the \"bearing\" is actually just a flat piece of relatively soft metal which the crank should never touch at least in a perfect world.

I understand that after the battery is depleted, a conventional motor kicks on and drive me the rest of the way. Based on my commute times, The conventional motor will only kick on for about 5-10% of my daily driving. Somehow I doubt this means that I will be able to get away with extending my regular oil change interval by 10-20 times it's regular length, as a 30,000 mile oil change interval seems unrealistic in the best circumstances. So, can someone who knows how this is calculated explain it?",
      "answer": "As race fever indicated, many modern cars, and all hybrids, will record how many hours the ICE (internal combustion engine) has been running. It appears the Ford C-max, along with most other hybrids, pass this clock into an 'oil life indicator' (should have called it Oil Indicator of Life, or OIL for short!), which calculates and displays an alert for when you should change the oil. The indicator is based on factors such as ICE run time, and time since last oil change (meaning it would still recommend oil changes if the ICE is never started, because oil will degrade over time).",

Sometimes I see a puff on start-up and sometimes I see smoke while accelerating, but it's intermittent.

My question is, to what extent does this really matter, beyond the cost of the oil burned?",
      "answer": "You said \"valve gaskets\" but I'm going to assume you actually mean the valve seals. Since you are seeing a small puff of smoke sometimes during startup and when you are accelerating, these are usually caused by two separate issues, both of which you are mentioning. Start-up puff of smoke can usually be attributed to bad valve seals. This is because oil will leak past them after engine shutdown. It then either pools on the back of the valves (if closed) or drips down past the valves onto the piston (if closed). When you start up the car, the oil burns off and causes the puff of smoke. Smoke on acceleration can usually be attributed worn oil control rings not doing their job and allowing oil to pass by them and into the combustion chamber. One of the issues which you could be causing is that the oil will eventually plug your catalytic converter (if it's still installed).",

      "context": "Background I think that my vehicle would probably benefit from having it's lubrication system being flushed out at it's next oil change. Checking prices of flushing oil at local suppliers I noticed that they are now also selling a variety of flushing additives (such as STP Engine Flush). With flushing oil I would normally drain old oil, half fill with flushing oil, run the engine at a fast idle for a 15-20 minutes to circulate it, drain it again, change oil filter and finally fill up with normal oil. With the additive you don't need to drain the oil twice however, you just add it to the old oil in the engine, run it for 15-20 minutes then drain it out with the old oil and change the filter/oil. Overall the additive option will be more expensive (£4 per flush rather than £2 per flush for my engine) but will take less time (one complete engine drain/fill rather than two). It would also be more environmentally friendly, as there would be less waste oil to dispose of. Question So, aside fr",
      "answer": "The main difference between the two is that flushing oil is extremely thin oil that theoretically should be able to get into partially blocked, thin passages without any issues and remove the accumulated gunk there as well. Oh, and out any slightly leaking gasket, too. It's usually also got a suitable cleaning additive if you've bought a good oil. The additive doesn't really change the viscosity of the existing oil in the engine and is supposedly \"just\" a concentrated detergent package that you'll find in your regular motor oil (and you can hope that there is no chemical reaction between the two - there normally isn't, but there might be a chance for that). If your oil is already holding a lot of contaminant in suspension and the oil filter is reaching its filtering capacity, then you might to more harm than good. I've used both, and I still (very) occasionally use flushing oil. However, for a decent running engine that hasn't suffered from a lot of contamination, I tend to prefer the third option - change the oil a couple of times in fairly short intervals, use a high-detergent oil (I like using diesel-specific oil that's also got the correct classifications for petrol engine, as that has a lot more detergents in it than the petrol engine variety) and change the filter every time. Oh, and use a high quality filter so it actually traps the contaminants that are cleaned out by the oil.",

A friend of mine, who worked as a motorbike mechanic when he was young, told me he puts a small quantity (125 ml / 4 oz) of 2 stroke oil in the petrol tank the first time he fills a car. He argues it helps the burn (break) in of the engine, making the piston ring seal better against the sleeve, or somehow doing tolerance \"matter less\". I've found information in the web on doing so to diesel engines, but not to petrol ones. Do you find doing so advisable? Anything to worry about if I do so? Does it sound logical? There is a related question on breaking in new cars, but not covering this idea.",
      "answer": "I have seen this (mixing 2 stroke engine oil in the diesel fuel by about 2% ratio) being done by some mechanics about 20-25 years back for breaking-in diesel engines. They believed that, this would help in lubricating diesel engine fuel pump and the engine combustion side of the piston rings during break-in period of the engine. They used to say that, 'the piston rings and the piston walls are polished better due to this indirect lubrication, subsequently extending the total life of the engine'. The current 2T oils burnout almost completely causing very less increase in carbon deposits on the piston tops. With the current pollution control norms, your catalytic converter could fail prematurely causing a bigger expense. Now a days with improvements in the lubrication technology and companies doing a break-in run of the engine at the assembly line, the engine life is extended to the limits. We may not need to do this for the current technology cars. For engines that are re-bored (re-built in the garage), this method of adding about 1% to 2% 2T in the fuel during break-in period could help.",

      "answer": "What does the oil itself look like? If the oil looks like oil (and not milkshake), just clean the cap and call it a day. More than likely you just haven't been running your vehicle enough. You need to take it out and completely get it warm which will burn off any moisture which might get into the crankcase. Moisture is a byproduct of the combustion process and will get into the crankcase. If you don't get the oil hot enough through usage, the yellowish foam can collect in the oil cap.",

      "question": "Why is antifreeze mixture not as stated?",
      "context": "To keep things short I poured 200ml of concentrated genuine ford super plus premium antifreeze (Ethylene glycol based) within a bowl. Then added 200ml of water to dilute the solution to a 50/50 mixture. It states on the bottle when mixed 50/50 with water the antifreeze should protect to -37 degree's Celsius however when tested with a floating balls tester it shows that the solution would only protect up to -23 degrees. To investigate further I purchased two more hydrometer (different manufacturers) which tested the solution at -23 same as the first hydrometer. I don’t believe that three hydrometer from different manufacturers are going to lie to me so I’m puzzled. After some research I found that -37 is the protection level that a 50/50 mixture should provide this is why I am confused. My question is what should I do? Should I add more antifreeze increasing the strength to -37 or should I keep the solution at -23 when using within my car? If there is anyone that can give information to",
      "answer": "The difference you observe is quite notable, so I wondered how reliable it is to just measure the density (which is what your hydrometer does). From the datasheet of your Ford antifreeze, the density is 1.10kg/l, while pure ethylen glycol has 1.10kg/l. Glysantin is another brand for antifreeze and states 1.122-1.125kg/l for its G48 (sorry, german) This differences aren't big, are they? Water has a density of 0.998203 kg/l (at 20°C, as all values above), so one could approximate the density of any mixture by a linear function: From this, a 50% mixture from Ford Super Plus Premium has a density of 1.047kg/l. The same density has a 40.7% Glysantin G48 and a 45.4% Ethylan Glycol mixture. According to Glysantin's website, a 1:1.5 mixture (i.e. 40% antifreeze) protects down to -27°C instead of -37°C, which is a vast difference! For pure ethylen glycol, I found this chart (in °F): http://www.eetcorp.com which also shows a serve reduction for lower concentrations of antifreeze. So, slight differences in density of the andifreeze will result in very different temperatures displayed on a hydrometer. This still does not explain your reading of -23°C, but the linear function is just an approximation, temperature changes density, too, and who knows what other effects there are. I think you can thrust a 50% mixture, but can increase it to 60%, as Paulser2 already said. However, pure water has the best cooling capability, and the more antifreeze you add, the worse it gets. Too much antifreeze, and you may get a heat problem in the summer.",

Is this the only option?",
      "answer": "I wouldn't use additives to plug a leak unless it's an emergency. That stuff migrates all through your cooling system gunking up everything it can in the process - including radiator tubes with a partial flow restriction... If you are fortunate enough to possess a brass radiator - take it to a rad shop to have the leak soldered. At the same time, get it boiled/rodded out since you've already taken the time to remove it anyway. However if it's a modern radiator w/ plastic end tanks and aluminum core, your best bet is just to buy a new replacement. Most of those style radiators are relatively inexpensive in the aftermarket, I replaced one in my 93 Honda Accord about 6 years ago and I think it was 80 dollars at the time. I think the old aluminum might have some salvage value at the scrap yard... Think about it this way - is saving 200 bucks on a radiator repair really worth the cost of an overheating related blown headgasket or worse? Previous owner of my motorhome overheated the rig so bad once it cracked the heads in addition to melting down the transmission. So yeah, going cheap on the cooling system can have painfully consequential effects down the road.",

      "question": "Is it feasible to use the exhaust heat to warm the engine block?",
      "context": "I have around 4 miles of city driving to get to work every morning and in the winter my car never reaches operating temperature during my short trip. In fact, I am lucky if I get the engine temp above 50C, and having warm air out the AC vent is one of my wildest dreams. I've seen footage from a thermal camera (flir) of the underside of a car as it was warming up from a cold start. The exhaust temp went from 5C to 90C in 1 minute and in 3 minutes it was up to 200C. Is it feasible to have a heat exchanger between the exhaust and the engine coolant to transfer that exhaust heat to the coolant, heating up the engine? There would have to be some sort of mechanism (diverter valve?) to ensure just enough of the exhaust gas gets to the exchanger so as to prevent overheating but engineers have faced far greater challenges. FYI: I guess VW must've read this question: https://www.roadandtrack.com/new-cars/car-technology/a10201136/why-volkswagen-uses-a-water-cooled-exhaust-manifold/",
      "answer": "The problem you'll have in extracting heat from your exhaust gases to heat your engine is twofold: Gases don't generally have a high specific heat capacity so though it's hot, it's not a lot of heat energy, and it'll take some time to heat up a large mass. The walls of your exhaust pipe are incredibly thin, and quite effectively insulated by the air around them so they will indeed heat quickly. If you took a fan and blew air over it to warm the air, you might be surprised how quickly your glowing cherry red exhaust cools down again. If you wrapped the exhaust pipe in a 2 inch jacket of water, it will take much longer to heat this contraption than it would the bare exhaust pipe The condensation caused by actively cooling the exhaust gases would be considerable and it's quite corrosive to the metal of your exhaust. You might find that it accelerates the rate at which you have to replace the heat exchanger or exhaust, and the associated cost of doing so makes it an economically unviable option Investigate whether your heater system is functioning properly; if your thermostat is stuck (partially) open (as they're designed to when they fail) then it will take a lot longer for your engine to reach operating temperature. It's in the best interests of fuel economy (and hence manufacturer reputation, so there's a market drive for this) for an engine to warm up quickly, and they're thus designed to have a really small cooling circuit (the engine block, and the heater matrix/exchanger that heats the cabin via the vents) thanks to the main thermostat being totally closed when cold, causing the engine to heat quickly, before the main radiator starts being used to dump the excess heat. Consider too, running the blower at a lower speed so you don't suffer human factors such as windchill meaning you perceive the air from the vents to be cooler than it is, because it is moving at high speed. Run the recirculate mode, so your heater is not drawing fresh cold air from outside, but kee",

I would be inclined to buy and pour in new coolant, however, after googling around I have few doubts now: She got engine gasket replaced outside BMW a year ago.

      "answer": "A few thoughts: In a pinch, any coolant is better than no coolant Even litigation-wary vehicle manufacturers will invariably recommend this in owner manuals (paraphrased from my W12 Touareg manual): If the recommended coolant/coolant grade is not available and the coolant level is low, top up the reservoir with distilled water and have the system evaluated by an authorized dealership as soon as possible. The reason for this should be obvious, but the consequences of engine damage from overheating is far worse than any impact of using the wrong fluid on the cooling system. Coolant evaporates and leaves a milky-white stain behind; that's oil on the radiator hose Given the oil filter housing is in the nearby vicinity I wouldn't be surprised if the stains are the remnants of a recent oil filter change. If the oil hasn't been changed recently, there may be a leak associated with the neighboring oil cooler or a crack in the oil filter housing. The power steering reservoir is also a possible culprit. I'd recommend cleaning the oil spots and monitoring to see if the stains return in the short term. Coolant type can matter Given that the coolant is blue, it could be that the cooling system has been adversely affected by the use of a coolant type it wasn't designed for, though I'm not sure if I would blame it for this vehicle's coolant loss woes.",

      "context": "I have recently fully rebuilt my engine, minus the block and pistons. All the gaskets were replaced, valves lapped, valve lashes tuned etc. I did it because I had an overheating problem and a head gasket failure. I performed straightedge and feeler gauge tests to make sure the previous overheating and head gasket failure did not cause cylinder head warpage. When I put the coolant back, I used one of these no-spill funnels to make sure the system is fully burped by running the engine with the funnel on, which would compensate with coolant any bubbles that get burped out. I really believe I squeezed every single little bubble out, also because I turned the heat on to make sure the heater core gets its flow. I also filled the overflow tank up to about half where the FULL notch is. What I noticed when I first drove it more than a few miles is that there was a splatter of coolant around the overflow tank, when I lifted the hood. I though the whole rebuild was in vain and overheating was bac",
      "answer": "Is the above a tenable explanation? No. While some thermal expansion happens in a cooling system, the amount which happens can be absorbed by the rubber hoses present in the system, unless the system overheats. When overheating occurs, steam is created, which causes pressure spikes, which causes more over heating, which causes more steam, etc. When a cooling system is behaving properly, it works together in harmony. The temperature is kept below the boiling point, while the pressured cap allows the boiling point to be raised. As the coolant flows through the radiator, excess heat is bled off which allows the boiling point to not be reached. Should you put no coolant in the overflow tank when refilling the system with cold coolant to leave enough room for thermal expansion ? You should fill the radiator up all of the way and fill the expansion (overflow) tank to the cold mark when first filling your system. In general, under healthy engine circumstances, how much coolant should be getting exchanged between the cooling system proper and the overflow tank? Is it to be expected that the overflow tank fills with thermal expansion overflow when the engine is hot (not overheated) and then that gets sucked dry (or evaporated) back into the radiator when the engine cools down? No, you should not expect thermal expansion. If the system is properly bled, you should have very little air in the system. This little bit of air may pass out to the expansion tank when the system is fully up to temperature, but this isn't a given. When the system cools down you'll see the system draw coolant back into itself from the over flow if it needs to. After it cycles the first couple of times, you may need to fill your overflow up a little to make up the difference. If there is a large amount of difference, you probably didn't bleed your system correctly. I am also an avid plumbing DIY-er. In case that you are too or at least familiar enough, does the coolant overflow tank in a vehicle perfor",

It's really hot outside, so that's why I prefer the garage. Maybe I'm being overly cautious, but, is this enough room to avoid carbon monoxide poisoning? I've always read it's really only a risk in single or double car garages.",
      "answer": "Is your Check Engine Light on? That's a rhetorical question, what I mean to say is that if your ’04 Forester is in good tune, it really should not produce that much carbon monoxide. Also, there are really no long-term health hazzards of non-chronic carbon monoxide exposure, other than death. (It binds with red blood cells in a way that prevents transport of oxygen.) However, short of death, recovery is fairly quick and leaves no \"mark\" so to speak. That garage area is huge. I would not be concerned. If you start feeling queasy or get a headache, you should shut off the ignition and get some fresh air outside. The dosing rate of CO on a modern fuel injected vehicle in good tune is very low, such that it's unlikely you would pass out before noticing you are not feeling well. In fact, morbid as it is, attempting suicide nowadays by running your modern car in the garage is likely to fail. The first health hazzard will be the consumption and displacement of oxygen; displaced by carbon dioxide, which is not nearly as toxic in the literal toxicology sense, but a hazzard if it displaces all available breathing oxygen. If you are very concerned, you can take the vehicle for a jaunty spin around a few miles, to get the vehicle in what's called \"Closed Loop\" — which will monitor and control CO emissions more precisely. Your '04 Forrester has an electricaly heated oxygen sensor which will do this on its own, it just takes a bit longer. Your safety is not mine to play with. CO detectors are cheap enough, available at most hardware/DIY stores, and run off a 9V battery. Once you're done detailing the interior, you can move it upstairs and run it in your apartment/home.

Just did a 300 mile trip at 3500-4000rpm. Next morning I noticed smoke and dark water coming out of the exhaust. Coolant is not dirty, smoke has decreased after coming back another 300 miles, but when I start the car it \"spits\" black soot/water. What could be the cause? I know some water out of the exhaust while it's cold is normal, but in this case, it happens at every start, even with a hot engine, and the soot is considerable. I've just seen a Mazda drip a few drops, which is normal, but if you see the video linked there is a lot of water and soot. The electronics in the car are not working very well either. Edit: There is no overheating, No oil in the cooling fluid and no other symptoms. Video of the actual problem",
      "answer": "There is nothing wrong, water is a byproduct of gasoline combustion. 2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O where C8H18 is the gasoline reacting with oxygen (O2) and giving Carbon-dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as the byproduct. So, this simply is: 2 * Gas molecules + 25 * Oxygen Molecules → 16 * Carbon Dioxide Molecules + 18 * Water Molecules So the black soot is just water mixed with carbon in exhaust pipe. Water usually comes out when engine is not hot enough like when starting it. So the liquid water drips out of exhaust with the carbon mixed in it making it black. But after driving a little the engine becomes hot and so thus the water and it comes out as steam. So you don't need to worry. EDIT : In some cases the cause of water leaking from exhaust is a blown up head gasket, or cracked head, but that also results in overheating of engine. Since your engine is not overheating so i would say that it's just water getting accumulated in our silencer and coming out when you start the engine. I can't say much about the electronics, maybe just some wires got loose. You should probably get that checked by someone in the garage. Hope it helped.",

      "question": "What is the &quot;dollar bill&quot; test?",
      "context": "One of the questions recently made reference to an exhaust failing the \"dollar bill\" test. How does one perform it and what does it tell you?",
      "answer": "The dollar bill test is quite simply using a dollar bill (any denomination ... doesn't have to be American currency, even) and placing it against the exhaust tip while the vehicle is idling. You are looking/listening to what the bill does while against the exhaust tip. If it just flutters there without making much noise, you have healthy exhaust valves. If it rattles against the tail pipe, you may have a burnt exhaust valve (no guarantees here), which would be a basis for further examination, such as compression and leakdown tests. What is happening is this, when an exhaust valve is burnt, it is no longer sealing against the valve seat. When idling, there is usually a great deal of vacuum created during the intake cycle. If the valve is burnt and leaking, you'll get reversion. Reversion is where the exhaust flow changes direction back toward the cylinder, which should not be happening. By placing the bill on the exhaust tip, the bill will rattle. The noise will be very noticeable. Please note, in order for this test to work correctly, you need to have a good exhaust system (without leaks). The bill also has to have a good fit over the exhaust tip. If it's too small, the effect wont occur. I don't know how well it will work with exhausts which have cross-over or h-pipes built into the system. The engine has to be idling as the vacuum is much less and the exhaust flow is much greater when the engine is off-idle.",

      "context": "I recently bought a 2008 Silverado 5.3 with 77k on it. After a couple weeks I noticed that at idle the engine would stumble and my rpms would drop slightly. It eventually set off the check engine light with cylinder 1 misfire and random cylinder misfire. A couple days later the light went off but the issues remain. Since then I've cleaned the MAF with MAF cleaner spray, cleaned the throttle body, and run a couple bottles of techron through to clean up the injectors, but no change. I dont know if it's related, but I also get a lot of dark blue/black (hard to say) smoke from the tailpipe on cold starts for a few seconds before clearing up. This led me to thinking I was getting oil in the cylinders when the rings cool and contract, which I tracked to known oil burning issues with these AFM engines. At this point I'm not sure what else to try before spending a fortune at the shop. My only remaining thought is to replace the plugs and coils. But even if that fixes the misfire I'm not sure w",
      "answer": "First of all, the 5.3l engine (could be all of the Vortec LS engines, don't know) is thirsty. It drinks a bit of oil. Be aware you could be looking at up to 2 quarts between oil changes. I don't know exactly what the issue is, but it does have a bit of an oil control issue whether it has to do with leakage or burning. My '06 is this way. It has never ran bad due to its use of oil (though obviously too much oil would cause issues for the cylinders as well as the cats). Your issue with running is most likely a bad coil. The easiest way to test this theory is to change the single coil out with a different one and see if the problem follows the coil change. You may also try to push in both the connector at the top, as well as both ends of the spark plug wire. You may consider changing out the plugs with new ones to see if this helps your issue. It could also be the spark plug on the No. 1 cylinder as well. If the spark plug is bad, it would give you the misfire, but spark plugs in these are supposed to be good to around 100k miles. You can pull the #1 plug and see what's going on with it. You'd be looking for a tan colored plug if it was running good. Obviously since you've already been getting a misfire code on #1, this may be moot. The third thing it might be is a stuck/leaking injector. I'm doubting this. You would need to pull the fuel rail, leaving the injector on the rail, then pressurize the system looking at whether it dumps fuel without the engine running to tell if this is an issue. This might account for the bit of black/gray/bluish smoke on startup.",

      "context": "Reports like this of people dying from CO poisoning in idling cars due to \"clogged tailpipes\" are disturbingly frequent. But how can this happen if the car is outdoors? First of all, how does a modern engine respond if tailpipes are blocked? If they are obstructed enough that exhaust can't escape the system why doesn't the engine stall? Second, since the engine does in fact somehow continue to run, how does exhaust end up in the cabin? I'm guessing that there's an obvious weak point at which the backpressure escapes the exhaust system, and that point must be near the cabin air intake? (But if that's the case, would setting the cabin airflow to recirculate prevent the intake of exhaust?)",
      "answer": "One way I could explain it from that photo, is that there will not have been any snow under the car, so the exhaust fumes will have easily been able to exit from the tail pipe and spread under the car. The fumes will then have gone into the engine compartment and from there could have been sucked in by the fan. Alternatively the exhaust could have had a hole anywhere along its length which once again would have allowed fumes underneath the car. If in perfect condition, there should be no where for fumes to exit the exhaust, other than from the tail pipe. If the tail pipe was totally blocked, the engine would slow down and stop. However, there is no way snow would be able to block the tail pipe sufficiently. Putting the heater on recirculate may have limited the intake of fumes, but a car's passenger compartment is not air tight, so the fumes will still find a way in if the car is totally surrounded by fumes as it will have been in that photo.",

My boyfriend said I need a power commander on it to make it richer. I thought Aprilia ECU's support flashing the ECU with a new map. Can someone provide guidance on this?",
      "answer": "Background The 2009 Aprilia Tuono has a writeable ECU but you need the appropriate equipment from Aprilia in order to perform the task. AFAIK there are no aftermarket tools to replace the ECU programming equipment provided only to Aprilia dealerships. As well, Aprilia recommends that you DO NOT put a piggyback ECU on it. It is one of the few manufacturers that actually puts out releases regarding this. The reason surrounds how the piggyback reinterprets data coming from the various sensors. When the standard ECU says to the injector, put in more fuel the message is proxied to the through the piggyback ECU on it's way to the injector and modified due to the mapping. If the piggyback gives more fuel than the standard ECU ordered it will reflect in the 02 sensors and then the standard ECU will lean it out as a result and the piggyback will increase and you receive very choppy throttle response. An example would be driving down the freeway at constant speed and feeling the bike surging quickly over and over. It's very slight and very annoying and very tiresome on long rides. General Information Aprilia is next level in it's view of performance upgrades. They offer race wire harnesses, race valves, pistons, bodywork, Ohlins suspension kits and performance slip on and full race exhaust systems. All covered under warranty and all included in the OEM parts inventory. They also make their ECU programmable to match the exhaust systems that are specifically designed for their motorcycles. Akrapovic is their exhaust partner, so it's great that you have an Akrapovic exhaust on that beast. It's the right one. I'm actually surprised you could source one for a 2009. I imagine you procured it from the UK or western Europe. They are all either titanium or carbon fiber. Only the best. Solution I hate to say this to you but....take it to the dealer. There is no other way unless you can somehow get your hands on the special ECU tool that costs upward for $3,000. IF you procured the Akro",

      "question": "What&#39;s ECON and how is it used properly?",
      "context": "I drive mostly Asian cars which mostly have an air-conditioning interface consisting of a button saying \"A/C\". This makes sense to me since it's short for \"Air Conditioning\" (assumption :)). Also the usage is pretty straight forward: you push the button and you gain cold air, release the button and it stops. However, lately I was driving with my friend's German Car (Audi) and the a-c interface completely confused me. I didn't even find it until my friend helped me out. Apparently you have to deactivate (!) a button saying \"ECON\". So it's on (a small orange LED indicates \"ON\") and you have to deactivate (the small orange LED turns off) it in order to activate the air-conditioning. What does ECON mean? How does this whole concept make sense? Why is it preferable above a common \"activate the AC\"-button?",
      "answer": "It probably has a Climate Control unit which regulates the temperature automatically. This means that the air conditioner should always try to reach the requested temperature. So when it's outside 30 degrees celcius and you request 20 degrees, then your car enables the A/C to reach that temperature. The A/C will stop running, when the temperature is reached, or even heat up the air when it become too cold. This happens when the outside temperature is lower than the inside temperature. If you enable ECON(Economy) mode, then you disable the air conditioner. The climate control cannot make your car cooler than the outside temperature. So when it's 30 degrees outside and you request 20 degrees, it cannot provide a lower temperature than 30 degrees. Heating up will not be any problem for conventional car because the car engine is hot enough to warm up the radiator. I don't know how this works on a EV car. If your car doesn't have a climate control, then you have a manual button to turn the A/C on. This is a dumb system which blows air continuously without checking the current temperature.",

      "context": "On a 2004 Chrysler Sebring, the air only works when turned up to maximum power. At any of the 3 levels below that, no air comes out. Additionally, when the heat is on, it only blows hot air while the engine is revving. When I release the gas, I can start to feel the air gradually cool down (especially at stop lights). This was not much fun in the winter - I haven't tested yet to see if the AC works the same way now that it's warm out.

      "answer": "As for the blower only working on max, that screams resistor pack. It's usually in the passenger foot well near the blower motor itself.

I usually put the seat back down as far as it will go and lay down facing forward and pull myself up under the dash. If you've been running the blower exclusively on high for a while, it might be the next thing to go out. Last time I changed a resistor, the blower worked for a couple days then died. That was a little more involved, but still doable if you don't mind being upside down in a tight space.

      "answer": "First, a word of warning. To do it right (and not waste expensive refrigerant, or risk ruining your A/C compressor), you'll have to get a few pieces of equipment. If you're just going to do this once, you could ask your local shop for a quote: the price might come out similar both ways. I'm going to explain how to do A/C by weight, as that is how manufacturers spec their cars. Car-Specific Specifications Car by car, you'll have a different amount of refrigerant required. For your particular car, you'll need to find out: What kind of refrigerant (most modern cars use r134a, and that's what I'm writing this up for, although some of the newest ones use r1234yf, and old cars might use r12 or r22. I'm focusing on the procedures for r134a since I'm not very familiar with the others.) How much refrigerant (this will generally be measured in ounces, and smaller cars will generally use less. I've seen anywhere from a tiny 12 ounces to a giant 54 ounces) This information can sometimes be found under the hood on a sticker on your car. How much oil for the A/C system. Generally, your car will use PAG oils (PAG 46, PAG 100, PAG 150), although it might also use PAO oils. It's generally best to stick with the same as you already have, but interchanging them is possible too. Your A/C sticker in the engine compartment might say how much your specific car uses, or you might have to look that up as well. Equipment First, you'll need a gauge. This is the thing that will tell you what the system's pressure is, and (importantly) also connect your hoses to the car and the coolant cans. Get one with two gauges on it, so you can see the pressure on both the high and low side of the car. Importantly though, you need one that reads down to 30in-Hg (that's inches of mercury - equivalent to 0 PSI absolute, or -14 PSIG \"gauge\") so that you can test a vacuum. Note that these \"manifold gauge sets\" are refrigerant-specific, as the fittings that are provided for one kind of refrigerant will not atta",

One knob controls the \"temperature\". I set that to max, obviously. The other knob controls how quickly air flows into the cabin. Should I set that to max (which heats the cabin the fastest), or should I set it to min, so that the hot air stays in the HVAC system instead of heating the cabin? (If I knew how it all works internally, and where the mold likely is, I'd figure it out, but I don't) Edit: found this illustration on agcoauto.com, which basically confirms what sweber wrote:",
      "answer": "The reason for the odor is that water condenses inside the ducts when the AC cools the air. Though there are drains, there will still be enough moisture in the system to allow mold to grow. The heating is usually placed after the AC. This is useful for screen defogging: The air is first dehumidified by the AC and then heated, which gives warm, extremely dry air. The other way, dehumidifying would not work. So I think you can't cook your mold, because it's sitting in the AC system, which you can't heat. Furthermore, mold dies when the temperature rises above 70°C for a longer period, may be one or two hours. This heavily depends on the type of the mold. Coolant of a warm motor typically has about 80-90°C, but it's possible that it has already cooled down a little when it flows into the heating part of the HVAC system. And the air may also not be fully heated to the temperature of the coolant. So, it's possible that the hot air is not hot enough to kill the mold. However, the air would be hottest for lowest fan speed. So, contrary to the answer you linked, I don't see how heating can help to dry the entire system. It only helps to dry the ducts between heater and vents, but not to dry the AC. The other answer is better: Run the system (also at high fan speed) without AC for some minutes to get as much humidity as possible out of the system. Also keep in mind: Once there is dead mold, this is perfect food for the next mold...",

If they put the gauges on the system and it didn't register anything, that's a pretty good sign it doesn't have any refrigerant in the system. If your car has completely lost its charge, this means there has been a catastrophic failure somewhere in the system ... it has lost its integrity and no longer is holding refrigerant. Unless you are an A/C mechanic, this is more than likely something which will need to go to the shop to fix. If the compressor did actually kick in, then whomever put the gauges on the A/C system to check it didn't do a very good job of checking. There is no way it will kick in without refrigerant in the system. You can, however do a very easy check by touching the A/C lines right at the firewall (or as close as you can get to the firewall) as they go into and out of the body of the car. Feel the lines and see if one is cold and one is hot (or warm since you aren't getting any benefit from the cooling).

      "question": "Does AC usage change based on blower speed?",
      "context": "As an example, my 2004 Honda CRV has air conditioning that is controlled by three controls: on/off button, blower speed knob, temperature knob. The blower speed knob affects the speed of the blower, the temperature just affects a gate to the heater core (not 100% positive my CRV works that way, but my other cars did), and the on/off button turns on/off AC, assuming the blower speed is at least above 0. Does the AC compressor or expansion valve actually change based on any of those? I imagine the combination of on/off and blower speed engage a clutch in the compressor that can only engage/disengage. So, is there any significant downside to turning the blower on max? Or, maybe I'm wrong and there are gears or something in the compressor or maybe the expansion valve is electronically controlled. Thanks!",
      "answer": "AC load absolutely varies with blower speed. On most modern vehicles (like your CRV, without an orifice tube) the amount of liquid refrigerant metered into the evaporator is controled by a Thermal Expansion Valve, or \"TXV\". The TXV takes it's cue from the temperature of the evaporator core. Here's a great desciption of (stationary) TXV operation Critical here is the pressure balance operation of the TXV: TXV Pressure Balance EquationTXV P1+P4 = P2+P3 P1 = Bulb Pressure (Opening Force) P2 = Evaporator Pressure (Closing Force) P3 = Superheat Spring Pressure (Closing Force) P4 = Liquid Pressure (Opening Force) Note that the \"bulb\" (P1) is a sealed system, with a refrigerant inside, but unrelated to the refrigerant in the rest of the system. The bulb is physically buried in the evaporator core, and reads the temperature of the core by thermal conductivity. The pressure inside the bulb rises as the core temperature increases. This pressure cooperates with the head pressure to open the TXV and allow more refrigerant into the evaoprator core. Now, the temperature of the evaporator core rises proportionately as the temperature and flow of \"hot\" air across it. It's not completely linear, as the efficiency of any heat exchanger is usually flat only across a narrow range of secondary flow. Fast moving air just doesn't maintain enough \"contact time\" for heat exchange. Nevertheless, the overall amount of work done by the system is ultimately dictated by the temperature and flow across two heat exchangers, the evaporator and the condensor. Another useful purpose of the TXV is to prevent evaporator icing, which has a runaway effect if left unchecked. Ice crystals block the airflow, less heat is absorbed into the evaporator, more ice is formed, less airflow ... The TXV bulb will radically drop in pressure as the evap temperature approaches freezing, and cause the TXV to completely shut off liquid refrigerant flow into the evaporator to prevent this condition.

      "question": "Can I use empty refrigerant bottles to store used refrigerant?",
      "context": "Based on symptoms and measurements, I have reason to suspect that my neighbour's car's AC system has too much refrigerant in it. Some of the refrigerant has to go. To my knowledge, even if environmental regulations penalize the local automotive repair industry for venting refrigerant to the atmosphere it is poorly enforced, so if the neighbour takes it to an average repair shop they wouldn't hesitate to mash on the valve release. Rather than act irresponsibly and release it to atmosphere, I would like to know if it is possible to use a spent refrigerant bottle (the disposable kind like in the picture below) to store the excess refrigerant so that I can take it to a specialist workshop that has the ability to recycle it at a later date. The thing I'm not sure about is whether these bottles can come with a one-way/check valve that ensures they can only be emptied, not refilled. Under Handling Precautions for HFC-134a Shipping Containers, I also found this: Never refill disposable cylinde",
      "answer": "tl dr: You can do it, but you probably won't be able to bleed very much off by this method. NOTE: Please see edit at the bottom. Most every can of DIY refrigerant I've ever seen (whether R12 or R134a) has a puncture top design (NOTE: AC Pro may be different, as it is an all-in-one). As you screw the adapter onto the top of it, there is a small tube which is cut on a bevel which punctures the top of the can, which then releases the refrigerant from the can and then is available to flow after you press the lever. There is no check valve at the top, but a thin piece of metal which contains the R134a until punctured. If the can were completely empty when you started, you could fill the can back up to whatever the maximum pressure of the AC system on the low side is at the time you are doing the bleed. This would allow you to bleed off some of the refrigerant. The question then becomes, can you bleed off all you need to bleed off? Without a means of sucking it out of the AC system and pumping it into the can, the best you can achieve is the pressure in the system. And then because the DIY method has you putting refrigerant into the low side, that's the maximum pressure you could attain. IIRC, that's usually a maximum of around 45psi. I know the low side does spike when the compressor goes off, but as it goes back on, it will draw some of that pressure back out of the can as things equalize. The other thing to think about is, if you want to use your DIY recharge device when you're done pulling what little R134a you can out of the system, you'll need to take it to the recycle shop before you can do so. You wouldn't want to use it in another car, as you run the risk of contaminating the system of the next vehicle you're working on. EDIT After finally seeing exactly what you are trying to use to store the R134a, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't be able to. This type of bottle has the valve to shut off the flow (either in or out) of the bottle. Once you get out of the ",

      "context": "I have a U.S. 2011 Volkswagen GTI. After the car wouldn't start (starter would crank but engine would not turn on) I decided it's probably time to replace the battery, and did. Car starts fine, but now the AC blower won't turn on at any setting. All the normal AC lights come on on the dash, and I can hear the engine revs changing when the compressor kicks in, but no air comes from the vents at any of the 4 fan settings. Here's what I've done so far Checked every single fuse (under the hood and under the dash) both visually and with a non-powered fuse checker. Disconnected the battery for about an hour and reconnected it (I read something online about allowing the system to reset, probably hogwash) Visually inspected the blower's resistor pack which is located under the passenger glove box.

      "answer": "The problem is resolved. I ended up taking it to the dealership, where apparently the fix was to \"redo all of the fuses in the engine compartment\". I doubt the problem was that I had a fuse in the wrong spot, seeing as I didn't touch the fuses when I changed the battery, and I know for a fact the blower worked the day before changing the battery. Unfortunately it will pretty much remain a mystery, but assuming the dealership was telling the truth, it was as simple as a bad fuse - despite them all testing fine with a fuse checker and not appearing burnt or broken. Looking back, I wish I would have taken out every single fuse and tested each for continuity and low resistance with my multimeter. I also really wish VW and other German car makers would include fuse diagrams in the owner's manual. The other possibility is that it wasn't a fuse at all - perhaps the tech unknowingly corrected the problem with a computer reset. There are a lot of variables in diagnosing electrical problems as I've come to understand - maybe the tech mispositioned a fuse before he started doing things with the diagnostic port. The good news is that the repair was \"only\" the $100 diagnostic fee my local VW dealership charges.",

      "context": "I would like to upgrade to HID lights in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler. The stock lights aren't bright at all. My question is, since this would be an aftermarket upgrade, what am I looking at here? Is it as simple as swapping in new bulbs? Are there other electronic modifications I would need to make?",
      "answer": "Xenon headlights require different electronics to drive them, but they also need different reflectors and also a light leveling system to prevent blinding the drivers of other cars, because the HID lights are so much brighter than traditional lights. If you look closely at a car with HID lights, with the lights shining on something in front of them, you will see that the lights basically cut off at a neat line along the top, where traditional lights illuminate up much higher. If you know someone with HID lights, ask them to show you when they start up. The ones in my car move up and down as they adjust to the load in the car, so that a load in the trunk won't cause the lights to shine higher than they're allowed to and blind oncoming traffic. I had done some research for my old '94 300ZX that I wanted to see if I could retrofit. The kit for them was $3,000 a pair, because of the leveling system and the electronics to drive them. My solution? I replaced it with a new car that had HID lights. They are totally worth it, they are lovely lights and I find when I'm driving my other car without them I keep thinking \"are the lights on?\" Another caveat: Some places are selling \"cheap\" HID light kits from Japanese models. However, they can't be used in the US or other left-hand-drive places because the left hand lights shine up higher than the right lights, and they can't just be swapped around. The lights for LHD cars are the opposite, where the right light shines higher. Additional details are available in this related question: KIA Soul Aftermarket Headlights",

It is the only one in the main part of the car (there is another one in the boot) and it would be a pain if I couldn't use it to charge my sat nav or phone whilst I am driving. Has anyone got any ideas?",
      "answer": "CAUSE As it turns out, after further investigation a coin had fallen in to the lighter and caused a short circuit at some point in the past. FIX To fix it (at least in my case - the most common problem), you need a new 15A (blue) automotive fuse and a flat head screwdriver (or anything to prize off the fuse box cover). In my car the fuse box is located between the drivers door and the main interior console of the car. Use the screwdriver to lever the cover off gently - you don't want to break any of the plastic clips that hold it secure! Now you should be able to see a fuse card diagram that will tell you which fuse it is that corresponds to the cigarette lighter. It may look different if you have a different car manufacturer. (source: auctionerrol.com) The cigarette lighter is fuse number 33 on the card so find the fuse in the car in the corresponding location. The shape of the fuse diagram will match the shape on the actual car. Now take the old fuse out using the tool provided and replace it with the new one. Put the fuse box cover back on and now your cigarette lighter should work! If it does not then you may need to replace the cigarette lighter itself which is much less common.

Modern vehicle assembly lines don't grease bulbs because the rubber seals are sufficient at keeping moisture out, the electrical connection can be made more reliably. Having said that, if the rubber isn't sealing properly, the grease may help with that and will prevent corrosion on the terminals. Getting grease or any other contaminant on the glass part of bulbs can shorten the working life of the bulb, its best to wear gloves to prevent skin oils from getting on there.

      "context": "After watching this video on voltage drop, it makes me feel like testing the resistance of various sensors and accessories with my multi-meter isn't really a reliable test of anything, since I can see correct resistance numbers with the system off, yet under load there can still be a problem with high resistance. For example, I could see OK numbers testing the primary and secondary coils on my coil pack, yet there could still be a voltage drop due to excess resistance under load. Same thing with testing the resistance of the plug wires. I'm exactly in this situation now. I strongly suspect a problem with the coil pack is causing some hesitation and rough idle problems, yet the resistance on the primary and secondary coils show up fine. I suspect this because swapping the standard plugs with fine tip, low voltage ngk g-power plugs caused about an 80% improvement in the problem but didn't make it go away completely.",
      "answer": "Voltage drop problems are very common in multi component, multi interface systems. For instance the starter motor has a cable that runs from the battery to the starter. The cable has ring terminals on the ends and those terminals are bolted to the appropriate component. High resistance at any of the aforementioned connection points is a recipe for voltage drop. Also the very large gauge multi stranded wire can be prone issues as well. Something specific to mention is that the test only checks the supply and return lines of the device and not the device itself. Inside an ignition coil a solid core wire is used to create the windings. The chances of damaging the thin solid core wire in the coil to create a voltage drop is tremendously small. The common failure mode for coils is a fracture of the wire which will cause the resistance to spike. You may be able to check the primary side if you so wish. Apply power to the coil and measure it's current consumption. Compare the current consumption of the two coils. Checking the secondaries for anything besides resistance or conductance to the secondaries would be fruitless because they are meant to operate at a high voltage. Trying to check then at operating conditions would be extremely difficult if not outright dangerous. A similar problem happens with spark plug wires. They are prone to fractures of the conductor. When that fracture happens the resistance shoots up tremendously. There is no good way to check them besides just resistance.",

      "question": "Is it necessary to have the good car&#39;s engine running when jumpstarting",
      "context": "When jump-starting a vehicle, one first connects the positive and negative terminals between the two cars: positive to positive and negative (good battery) to a bolt head on the vehicle with the dead battery. Next comes the actual jump-starting part - turning the engine of the vehicle with the dead battery. My question is does the the engine of the car with the good battery have to be running before one attempts starting the engine of the vehicle with the dead battery, and if yes, then why?",
      "answer": "Your description of connecting the two cars is correct. I want to emphasize making the last connection to the \"bolt head\" you mention. Any large piece of unpainted metal will do. The reason for this is to keep the resulting spark away from the battery. If they battery has been venting fumes, the spark can (although it's very unlikely) cause them to ignite and explode. Back to your question: It is better to have the \"good\" car's engine running, because its alternator will be able to provide current to the \"dead\" car in addition to keeping the good car's battery charged. Once the cables are connected you can wait a few minutes for the dead car's battery to charge up a bit. Often, however, the good car will often be able to provide enough power to start the dead car right away, without waiting. Also, when the dead car actually cranks up, its own alternator can cause a significant spike into both car's systems. Now that cars rely so heavily on digital electronics, this spike can damage the controlling computer. It is wise to turn on the headlights of both cars before starting the bad car. Any surge will be dampened by the light bulbs, which will flow more current when the voltage increases. (If you're having to wait for the dead battery to charge, keep the headlights off while you're waiting.) Both of these events (the exploding battery and the fried computer) are really unlikely, and people jump cars without these precautions all the time. But, in this case, it doesn't hurt to be safe :) Finally, after disconnecting the cables, make sure the previously-dead car stays running for a while! You need to give the battery some time to charge up again. Good luck!",

This is the troubleshooting I have done so far: Tested the battery unplugged at 12.67 volts. Tested the battery running at 13.7-14.3 volts. Tested the amp draw resting at 0.27 amps. After 40 minutes this drops to 0.10 amps with the doors shut. Tested the amp draw with the door opened but latch pressed in to simulate a closed door. Similarly at 0.27 amps until it drops again to 0.15 amps. Removed fuse 26 with door open - dropped from ~3.8 amps to 0.15 amps (my guess is this controls the dome light) Removed fuse 25 with door open - dropped from ~3.8 amps to 0.02 amps. Repeated step 5 with the door simulated closed and after waiting for the drop for 40 minutes. Also dropped to 0.02 amps after removing 25. Before 25 was removed, 26 was removed with no effect (stayed at 0.15 amps) I have concluded that fuse 26 is of no concern, since the simulated closed door at b",
      "answer": "So after looking up what a GEM was (its the Ford name for the thing that controls the majority of the interior and some of the exterior electronics, if anybody else was wondering), A reasonable first guess is the aftermarket alarm. Aftermarket electronics are rarely designed in a way that is electrically sound, and even more rarely installed correctly. From personal experience, for almost any electrical problem, I would absolutely start there. If that isn't the problem, you'd need to go through everything that connects to the GEM, just like you said. I have not been able to find a definitive list of what that entails. You may be able to make some educated guesses (burned out dome lights, seatbelt beeper doesn't beep anymore, any non-functioning electronic, etc.) Its also worth noting that, per your source, fuse 28 is also GEM. edit: and fuses 10 & 20 From reading on a few different Ford forums, it seems as though the GEM getting wet is an issue for certain years/models, although I haven't found mention of the Ranger. Still might be worth a look; its hard to tell from the photos if you can get at it easily or not.",

      "context": "I experience a bunch of problems with my 2007 Mazda 3's electrical system: The most annoying issue is that I hear [a rather loud] engine noise when I connect a phone to the AUX (3.5mm audio jack) line while it is simultaneously being charged through a cigarette lighter adapter. The noise goes away when the power line is disconnected. Somehow related to this issue: even when the charging cable is disconnected and the aux input is in use, whenever I change the [automatic] transmission into/from \"Parking\" mode, the connected phone panics (hangs). It seems as if a surge goes through the AUX line. Similar threads on this forum [1, 2] suggest ground issues as the possible root cause of these kind of problems. Is there any systematic method to isolate/find the fault? [1] Audio noise when laptop connected to power inverter and the car's 3.5mm audio jack [2] Series of troubling electrical problems in my '07 Mazda 3. Any ideas?",
      "answer": "Your problem could be caused by two things. A shitty car charger, they are not all created equal, or a ground loop. As far as the charger goes try several different ones, name brand ones tend to be the best (htc, iphone, samsung, etc...). If the problem goes away then it was the charger. As far as a ground loop, what happens is that the ground potential in the cigarette lighter is slightly different than the head unit. A better way to say this is one has a better ground than the other. What happens is that the device with the worst ground will hunt for a better ground. That ground is found in the device with the better ground and a current develops in the audio cable. This current (regardless of the direction) shifts the reference point of the audio contributing to noise. A ground loop isolator blocks DC (the bad current) and allows through the AC (the audio). A car has a star based grounding system. There are like 6 or 7 main grounding points in the entire car. Some are under the hood and some are in the cab/trunk. If you narrow it down to a ground loop issue you can hunt for an systematically clean every ground. Unbolt the grounding point. Clean both sides of the eye and the body surface it bolts to. Apply some dielectric grease to both sides of the eye and the body to prevent corrosion. Bolt it back down. To find these grounding points you need the vehicles service manual or access to a service manual system. These will have a list of all the ground points and pictures of their locations.",

      "question": "Could 1.9 Nm be enough to accelerate 130kg electric go-kart?",
      "context": "I'll apologize in advance for a fuzzy question. My problem consists of two parts. For starters, I'm trying to buy a DC engine for learning purposes and most of them only specifies the watt (which I can use in order to convert and get the horse power that I'm normally used to) or torque. And secondly, I've never built something like this before, usually I build bikes or cars. Normally engines are pre-designed to haul a car or two but when it comes to DC engines I could accidentally buy something that's meant to drive a overhead crane. What torque would be required to match your run-of-the-mill go-kart that you usually find at theme-parks or amusement parks (I understand that a 70 bhp go-kart doing 120mph is another ballpark)? Would 1.9 Nm be enough? Sounds weak when my bike weighs 196 kg with 96 Nm does 0-60 in roughly half the time a normal go-cart reaches it's top speed. TL;DR: Could 1.9 Nm be enough to accelerate 130kg as fast as a \"normal\" go-kart? For instance this: http://www.alib",
      "answer": "This is a great vehicle dynamics question that essentially has two parts to it: Is the motor able to hit top speed, 120 mph? Is the torque enough to accelerate it to top speed within 5 seconds? The motor in question Power : 1000 W (~ 1.36 hp) Speed : 3200 RPM Torque : 1.91 Nm Something interesting to note here is the apparent discrepancy between the three quantities. Since the three quantities are related, one could back-calculate how much power is delivered by the quoted torque at 3200 RPM: Power = Torque x Angular Speed = 1.91 Nm x ( 2π / 60 x 3200 RPM ) 1/s = 640 W So clearly, something is up with the manufacturer's claimed figures. For 1000 W output at 3200 RPM, the required torque should be around 3 Nm, not 1.91 Nm. However, errare humanum est, so we'll stick with the generous 1000 W for the rest of this answer. So what does 1000 W buy? In short, not much. The aerodynamic drag force alone, in the absence of other parasitic factors such as rolling resistance, inclinations and headwind, is enough to severely limit the top speed of the go-kart. At top speed, the motive forces on the go-kart equal the drag forces acting on it (resulting in zero net force, zero net acceleration). According to physics (and the Bosch Automotive Handbook): Aero Drag = 0.5 x Air Density x Drag Coeff. x Cross-Sectional Area x Speed² With some reasonable assumptions for a go-kart: Air Density = 1.225 kg/m³ at sea level, 15 °C Drag Coeff = 0.4 (generous for a go-kart) Area = 0.5 m² (rough, based on a 1.2 m wide chassis) The aerodynamic drag is a function of the square of the vehicle's speed: Aero Drag = 0.1225 x Speed² How does this relate to power required? Power = Resistive Forces x Speed Assuming that aerodynamic drag is the only resistance that the vehicle needs to overcome, the power required to overcome this force can now be estimated: Power = 0.1225 x Speed³ What this means is that if you double the top speed requirement, you need eight times the power. So at best, 1000 W at the whe",

      "answer": "When working on electronics, you are best served by disconnecting the battery. The normal sense of your safety (arcing between hot to ground causing burns) is probably not an issue with this. The main issue is protecting the electronics. Even small discharges of electricity (static or from battery) can fry circuit boards or permanently damage the components. Disconnecting the battery helps to keep these very sensitive items from getting harmed. The simple act of disconnecting the power and/or ground from these instruments can cause the small discharge of electricity which I'm talking about.

      "context": "In extension of this Q about the power outlet I have a related question about how to secure the USB charging cable that runs from the power plug in the cigarette lighter socket to the corner of the windshield? I have a GPS device (or a cell phone cradle) in the corner of the windshield. I need to run a USB cable there to provide power to the device. I have a simple USB power plug for the lighter socket, and a black USB cable that is long enough to cover the distance while following the bends and curves of the dashboard -- so it's not a clothesline strung straight through the car. It can be neat and tidy along some ridges and edges, if I find a way to do it. How do I affix the cable to the dashboard in a reasonably simple yet elegant way?

      "answer": "I would take a different route. Starting at your end point (the green dot) put the connector on the dash where you want it. Run the cable next to the front vent glass. Push the cable down the crack between the glass and the dash. Open the door. There is usually room to run small cable down the left side. Sometimes you can tuck a single cable under the weather striping. Look for a seam in the trim to make a transition under the dash. Run the cable under dash along any existing harness to the center console. At the center console run the cable down the back. Once you reach the floor take the route you have already diagrammed. The plastic housing around the gear select will usually have some give and press into the carpet. Just push the cable under the housing. Once the cable is ran use zip ties to secure it in place. There are some zip ties with sticky pads on them that you can use behind the A/C control area. You shouldn't have to remove anything major. Making the transition from the door jam to under the dash will be the only tricky part. Just keep in mind that you do not want to run the cable in the way of anything that moves. Good luck!",

I'm trying to figure out what path to take to determine where the fault lies without hopefully having to trace and inspect the wire from the cab to rear of the vehicle looking for points where it is grounding out.",
      "answer": "There are only a few parts in play here. The reverse light switch in/on the transmission, the wiring to the rear of the vehicle, the tail lamp assembly, and the lightbulb itself. I would check the bulb first. If the filament is broken in just the right way, it can cause the flashing symptoms that you're experiencing. The part number for the bulb is 3156 (single filament). If that's ok, see if you can get access to the reverse / backup switch in the transmission. With it still in the car, test it with a multimeter to see if it reliably turns on and off (if you can access it). Alternately, you can unscrew it from the tranny to test it, but I imagine it will be difficult to get at. You may have to remove the shifter boot to access the switch, or you can try to get at it from below. Does adding extra pressure to the gear knob (holding it in place) help when backing up? If so, that points to the switch being at fault (or to an alignment issue between the gear lever and the switch).",

      "answer": "It is much more likely that the IMRC is damaged. The voltage on the line between pin 1 and pin 42 is provided by the IMRC. The PCM then pulls that voltage to ground to turn the IMRC on. When the IMRC is on the voltage on pin 5 drops to below 1v. In your case the the voltage between pin 1 and pin 42 is always below 1v. This could mean one of two things. The PCM is always grounding the pin. In this case the voltage will always be below 1v. But this also means that the IMRC will be on all the time and the voltage on pin 5 will also always be below 1v. This is not the case. The IMRC is no longer supplying power and regardless of whether the PCM commands the IMRC or not the voltage will always be below 1v. In this case the IMRC will always be off. This is signified by that the voltage on pin 5 is always high. First make sure that the voltage on pin 2 of the IMRC is B+. If it's not then diagnose this first. Next pull pin 42 out of the PCM. Run the engine and check what the voltage is on the pulled out pin. It should be B+. If it's not but the voltage on pin 2 from the previous test is OK the the IMRC is damaged. Issue 1. The IMRC has two circuits inside. A high power circuit and a low power circuit. There is no electrical link between the two circuits, only a mechanical link. The high power circuit contains the control transistor and motor. The power comes through pin 2 to the control transistor. Then goes to the motor and the gets grounded through pin 3. To turn on the motor pin 1 gets grounded. The PCM can not provide high power. All the PCM provides is a low power control signal which in this case is a ground. The PCM ground pin 1 turning on the IMRC control transistor and therefore the motor. In this case the current flows from the base of the IMRC control transistor to the PCM. The low power circuit is the sensor. The sensor is just a dumb switch. The PCM contains a pull up resistor to 5v. When the switch is open the PCM sees 5v. When the switch closes current flows ",

      "question": "Why do the batteries on some cars need to be hot-swapped?",
      "context": "By \"hot-swap\" I mean ensuring that the new battery is connected in parallel to the old battery while the old battery is removed and the new one is installed in its place. The idea is to ensure that the vehicle electricals/electronics are never without battery. I've seen mechanics do this on a few Japanese vehicles (2008 Nissan Pathfinder, 2009 Mitsubishi Pajero). I have also heard of one person lose central locking on his 2007 Nissan Patrol after failing to hot-swap his battery out during a replacement DIY. Are these observations some kind of urban myth or are the vehicles designed like this from the factory? If yes, why? If not, why do mechanics (even at dealerships) observe this practice?",
      "answer": "This is mostly a courtesy to customers to save driver settings that get lost when power is removed. Some cars can loose all their engine management setting requiring the car to \"re-learn\" how to run, resulting is poor fuel economy, poor performance, poor starting, and/or poor shifting. As mentioned in the comments, revolving code key fobs work on a time clock based algorithm to make sure the codes are synced between the fob and the car. The codes change with every press and at set intervals over time. These cars often have a relearning mode that allows the car and fob to sync again after power loss. Many devices are available to keep power available to the electronics while changing the battery. The most common method is to place a charger on the positive lead and a ground while the battery is removed. However this makes the installation more dangerous as sparks are more likely. Most newer vehicles make use of flash memory as its performance is on-par with older memory and it is not affected by the power loss. Some also make use of small builtin rechargeable batteries that maintain memory when power is lost.",

My understanding is that Zetec is sort of the ford equivalent of an Astra SRi (given that ST is the equivalent of a VXR). The only thing that really threw a spanner in the works for me was the drum brakes on the back wheels. I had a look around and found that the latest two models of VW Polo have discs, as do Golf's from Mk4 onwards, as do most Seat Leons, and even Prius's! Why on earth would a reputable company still fit this ancient technology, when most modern cars are using rear disc brakes? And, how much of an impact do drum brakes have in comparison to disc brakes?",
      "answer": "Drum brakes are cheaper to manufacture than disc brakes, because there are fewer moving parts and because in the rear the parking brake (which often works by a drum-and-shoe mechanism even on four-wheel-disc-equipped cars) can share a drum with the \"regular\" brakes. All other things being equal, discs work better than drums, especially in wet conditions. However, in this case, in regular driving you will very likely never notice a difference. Most of the braking effort, even in a panic stop, comes from the front wheels. So front discs are much better than front drums, but rear drums are not much worse than rear discs.",

Or likewise, I take my car down a gigantic hill and don't use engine braking. Two questions: Can I let them cool down, then safely drive off to go home? Will I need to replace them immediately afterwards, or just when they get thin as usual? I suppose the core of this question is \"After overheating, do brakes cool down to their original state, or do they substantially lose effectiveness?\".",
      "answer": "My experience, limited to a few very specific configurations is: I've never had rotor warping issues even after a LOT of heat in the brakes (both from track days and also stuck brakes while driving on the express way). I've used generic NAPA rotors, OEM rotors, and fancy heat/cryo treated ones. I can't tell any difference between any of them. They all function like big slabs of metal heatsink. :-) The brake pads themselves (including dirt cheap ones, Carbotechs, and Porterfields) have always worked the same after being very hot as before. However, the cheap ones and the Carbotechs (Panthers, a fine brake pad overall, but just not up to stopping a car as heavy as mine with such small brakes and so much power) went in the trash the day after the events I used them as they performed so poorly while hot. If you boil the brake fluid, you should bleed the system as it does seem to lose a little effectiveness (but was nowhere near as bad as I had expected). Wet boiling point seems to be more important than dry. I've boiled 2 week old Motul 600, but the off the shelf at the auto store synthetic (with much lower dry boiling point, but higher wet boiling point) is fine in my cars on the track for years. A bigger concern is the condition of the caliper seals. I've melted the seals out of the caliper without hurting the pads, rotors, or boiling the fluid before... That happened only with cheap pads, better quality pads have backing plates that provide at least some insulation value. :-)",

What caused this and what do I need to fix to get the full stopping power back? Do I need to bleed the front brake? Please give step by step instructions if possible.",
      "answer": "It is unlikely that simply removing and re installing the wheel would cause air to enter the brake system, though I suppose if someone had repeatedly squeezed the brake lever while the wheel was off the bike, that could have run the master cylinder reservoir dry and admitted air. One should never apply the brakes unless brake pads and brake rotor are all present and in place. If air was in the brake system, the lever should feel \"mushy\" compared to before. If it feels mushy, go ahead and bleed the brakes. I would also check to make sure that the pads in their proper position in the caliper, and make good contact with the rotor. It's possible they got knocked around during the wheel change. It is also possible that the pads or rotor have simply become contaminated during the wheel/tire change. If the lever feels firm and you have decreased stopping power, this may be the cause. Try spraying everything with some brake cleaner. As to how to bleed the brakes, you may need two people, though on a motorcycle you can generally do it with only one. locate the bleed nipple on the brake caliper, and ensure that you can loosen it. If it is stuck, hit the threads with penetrating oil and use a flare nut wrench or a six-point socket to break it loose. Gently re-tighten the bleed nipple. locate the brake fluid reservoir on the master cylinder, and remove the cover. protect any paint in the area, as brake fluid can quickly damage paint. Also, keep this stuff off your skin. Check that there is some brake fluid left in the reservoir, as the bleed process will consume brake fluid and you must not run the reservoir dry or you will pull more air into the brake system, and this is the very problem we're trying to fix. affix a piece of clear tubing to the bleed nipple, and run the other end of the clear tubing into a small plastic bottle or other suitable container to hold the old brake fluid. with the bleed nipple closed, squeeze the brake lever (or press the brake pedal).

      "question": "How much disc brake drag is acceptable?",
      "context": "As far as I know brake pads are supposed to maintain slight contact with the rotor at all times. As usually the only thing pushing the piston back after braking is flex of the square cut seal around the piston (which has quite a short travel path), eliminating drag completely is difficult (and probably pointless). However: When is it safe to say that brakes are dragging too much? For example, should the wheel be spinning freely when you turn it by hand (jacked up, of course) even if there is a slight dragging noise? Should the discs be cool after a calm drive? Should only the wheels be cool? Is a seized piston the only reason for brakes dragging (if properly sized pads and rotors are installed)?",
      "answer": "What is a freely spinning wheel? Of course, you should be able to spin the wheel by hand, but beneath the brake, bearing and transmission can apply lots of drag. My rear wheels do about 1.5 to 2 turns, my front wheels not more than half a turn when I put them in rotation by hand. While it's the same for the front wheel of my mother's car, its rear wheels seem to spin forever. It's best to compare the left and right wheel to get an idea about the expected drag, furthermore, one can compare the drag before and after removing the caliper as well as after removing the pads. (Pads alone can be seized due to dirt / corrosion, too) Temperature also gives a good hint on whether a brake is seized or not. Highly seized brakes produce lots of heat, slightly seized ones still a little. But again, it is not easy to judge if a wheel is slightly seized, as the temperature depends on drive behavior, weather and the car itself. And the bearings and tires also produce some heat. It is again best to compare right and left side. In my experience, I once had a highly seized brake in the rear which still wasn't noticeable while driving. But after, I could feel the heat on my skin when standing away one meter from the wheel... I now have a infrared thermometer and measure temperature of wheels and discs from time to time. The second time I had a highly seized brake (front), the wheel had a temperature of 100°C (210°F), and the disk of nearly 300°C (570°F) after driving 120-140km/h (75-85mph) for 30min plus driving home at low speed for 5min. The seizes brake was only noticeable while driving at that high speed, as it started to make noise and the car pulled to the side when braking. It was not noticeable when driving in the city. However, don't be too paranoid. When my rear discs and pads had been replaced, the temperature difference between the discs was 20-30°C, but as the brakes broke in, the temperature difference decreased and now is in the order of 5-10°C. My left/right discs now di",

      "question": "Brake pads sliding (?) between reverse and forward?",
      "context": "I just had my rear discs and pads replaced (2015 Golf). Everything seems fine, but if I'm backing up and press the brakes, there will be a \"clunk\" on one or both sides; when I then drive forward and press the brakes there will be another \"clunk\". It isn't loud, but it's clearly present. If I don't switch directions and brake it won't happen again; only when I brake in reverse (and then the next time I brake going forwards). This didn't happen before the replacement, and I haven't heard it while driving other cars. It sounds like the pads are sliding to one side of the calipers when I brake in one direction, and then the other side when I brake in the other direction. Is this right? Should I take it back to the shop and complain, or is this completely harmless? I don't care (much) about the noise; I just wonder if it's causing wear, or an indication of some other problem. (I'm guessing this post was talking about the same problem, but it wasn't explained clearly and there were no answer",
      "answer": "Could be a couple of problems but most likely in my mind is that the calipers are not properly fixed to the caliper brackets or the caliper brackets are not properly fixed to the the wheel hub. I think my next move would be to CAREFULLY take it back to the shop and have them sort it out at their expense. If the pads are sliding then they are the wrong pads for those calipers and that too needs to be corrected ASAP.",

Is it safe to install the rotors and pads on both the front and rear passenger wheels first - then back the car out of the garage and pull it back in on the other side so that the driver side gets the room to work? Any problem doing one side and then the other instead of both front and then both rear?",
      "answer": "I'm going to assume you have a very good reason for not taking the other car out of the garage to give yourself more room... People replace either the front or rear brakes together because they are \"on the same axle\" and replacing one side doesn't make sense because both sides should wear at the same rate. Replacing one side could make the car pull to one side or other strange behavior. That said, I don't see any reason you can't change one side immediately before changing the other side. I wouldn't drive very much like that because how the brakes might react is hard to predict, but if you're literally just backing out and then back in - go for it. Before backing up, make sure that the brakes have pressure. I'd hate for you to introduce air into the lines then try to back up and keep going because the brakes don't work!",

You will need the correct vented, thicker, disc as the caliper has a « jaw » sufficiently large for the combined thickness of pads and vented disc.

E.g. if your old pads were down 1/4\" in thickness relative to new ones, and the surface of each pad is, approximately 3 sq in, the volume of fluid in the tank should be higher by 4 pads x 3 sq in surface x 1/4\" recovered thickness = 3 cu in.",
      "answer": "While there is going to be a correlation between the loss of friction material and the amount of fluid in the reservoir, there is not a direct relationship you can quantify. Every make/model/brand of vehicle is going to be a bit different as far as the size of the caliper piston and the size of the brake pad supporting the stopping power. The amount of fluid is going to equate to the amount of friction material which is gone, multiplied by the surface area of the piston which is in the caliper. The size of the piston is what's going to relate to the amount of fluid missing from your master cylinder, not the amount of pad which has been consumed. The surface area of the pad does not come into play (the depth of pad used does, because the piston will travel this same basic amount). Another factor to consider when looking at this is, most calipers used on passenger cars today have a single piston which is located on one side of the caliper. What happens when you have multiple pistons on one side of the caliper, or multiple pistons on both sides of the caliper. You could have pads with the exact same surface area, but could be utilizing far more brake fluid as the pistons move further out of their caliper bores.",

      "answer": "It's not so much that the motors can't brake like mad. It's as you hint at yourself that any auto-mobile that is required to be fully road legal needs two completely separate systems for braking, in case one of them fails. It's why even the most automated gas-fuelled cars still had a hand-brake type system.

Randomly, it will decide to make this blood curdling screech when I apply the brakes, and occasionally the noise will continue as I accelerate, like something is stuck in the wheel. Nine times out of then this will only occur if I've been on a gravel road recently. As a sizeable portion of my driving is on gravel roads, I'm wondering what exactly it is that I can do to make this stop occurring, if anything? Car details: I drive a 2005 Honda Civic Si 4d, no modifications to the drive train or other outside components at all have been performed.",
      "answer": "It shouldn't be possible for gravel to get caught in the brake itself, but it could get caught in the brake caliper mounting bracket(s) or between the brake caliper and the wheel, the latter especially if you've installed bigger brakes or different-sized wheels. To be certain: look for scoring or other damage to your braking surfaces — that is, to your discs or to the inner surface of the drums (if it has drum brakes on the rear). Brakes often have dust shields mounted on the inboard (towards the center of the car) side. If one of those is missing, that might allow gravel to get stuck in places where it might not otherwise. Also consider the possibility that the gravel is getting caught in the suspension someplace, and then squealing when braking causes the suspension to move. Try looking under the car at the suspension and driveshafts. If you see dirt or small bits of gravel anywhere, that suggests a place where road debris can accumulate. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what you can do about this other than drive more slowly and try to kick up less gravel. On the chance that the gravel isn't the culprit, consider these questions covering brake squeals: Brakes make grinding noise during stops at low speeds Squeaky Brakes: How much of a concern are they?

Both are very capable of locking all 4 at the same time and skidding.

About two weeks ago, something started happening when I braked for the first (or sometimes) second time during a trip, but only intermittently. There was a knocking feeling (no sound initially) on the brake pedal, two to four shudders that feel like someone is hitting pedal lightly with a hammer from underneath. My ABS light would come on for a couple of minutes, then turn off. The brakes don't feel different, and the rest of the trip no matter how long, would be fine. It's more common on cooler mornings, but not exclusive to them. From limited testing, it happens during equally on slow/easy stops and fast/hard stops. I booked the car into a mechanic, but with the pre-holiday queues, I had to wait another week. During that week, whatever was happening started making a noise too. The knocking feeling is accompanied ",
      "answer": "If the ABS light will turn on every time the you feel the shudder in the brake pedal, then the ABS braking is being actuated. This could be caused by a tire skidding or the ABS computer thinking a wheel is skidding. The wheel speed sensors report the speed of each wheel to the ABS which determines if the car is skidding. You mentioned that it happens on slow/easy stops. I would said a wheel sensor is reporting that a wheel has stopped even though the wheel is still turning. One of the wheel speed sensors is probably damaged. Yaris forums report a lot of problems with the rear wheel speed sensors.",

If the fluid is up onto the brake line, I'd suggest this is actually the source of your leak. It could also be where the line attaches to the caliper. There is usually a banjo bolt which has two copper (or brass) washers on them. While not a tendency, these washers have been known to leak.

      "answer": "General Motors is well known for ABS problems. The problem comes from the speed sensors in the wheel bearings. The sensor slips into the wheel bearing and reads a toothed wheel inside. These sensors are very senesitive to the distance between the end of the sensor and the toothed wheel. When the gap gets too big the sensor can't properly read the toothed wheel at low speeds. The gap gets too big when rust builds up between the sensor and the surface of the bearing. This layer of rust actually pulls the sensor out of the bearing slightly. It is possible to find out what wheel bearing is having a problem by monitoring the speed of all the sensors with a scan tool. The first sensor to drop out as you slow down is the problem child. It is possible to remove the sensor, clean the surface and reinsert the sensor. It is difficult because if the bearing is rusty then the sensor is difficult to remove without breaking it.",

EDIT: Applying a little Google-foo to the problem turned up this: [PTFE is a white solid at room temperature, with a density of about 2.2 g/cm³. According to DuPont its melting point is 327 °C (620.6 °F), but its properties degrade above 260 °C (500 °F). So the question can be refined to is that high enough to avoid problems with front disc brakes? Since the tire begins to soften to the point of not working well at roughly 160 to 170 deg C (320 to 338 deg F) it should be fine. Does this match what folks have seen or tested in the real world?

When braking, even a light tap on the brakes can cause the car to start to skid, even after the brakes have been in use for 10-15 minutes. It feels like it is the drum brakes locking, but I don't know for sure. Do the self tensioners sometimes over-compensate and need to be",
      "answer": "Four things come to mind. The first two could be a result of mileage or age. The axle seals may be leaking gear oil on to the brake shoes. The oil will make the shoes grabby (if that is a word). The effect is that the shoes tend to grab or stick when applied. If the leak is slight, it may not have been noticed when the shoes were changed. Over time it slowly contaminated the shoes. A slight leak in a brake wheel cylinder will have the same effect as above: the brake fluid will make the shoes sticky. As drum brakes have become obsolete technology an alternative problem may be incorrect reassembly. Typically the shoes on each side consist of a long shoe and a short shoe. The long shoe is usually facing the rear, the short shoe faces the front. The length difference may be less than 1/2\" so it is easy to miss the difference. Also the automatic adjusters look identical. They are not however and have a left and right side. The left side is left-hand thread, the right side is right-hand thread. Switching either the shoes front to rear or the adjusters left to right can cause a myriad of problems. From continuously being out of adjustment to banging on application, parking brake malfunctions and lock-up problems.",

I think my 2006 4 Runner was the worst of the bunch, the only bad thing about that car. I've always either replaced or turned the rotors. (Now I just replace) I replaced the brakes and rotors on my current car, a 2012 Toyota Sequoia last November. They were pulsing on and off at times when stopping at highway speeds, but I just noticed (11 months later) the brake pads were completely worn and the rotors visibly worn too. I found a post here about measuring the rotor runout after installing the rotors, I have never done this for any of my brake jobs, but the poster said it elimited his rotor issues.

      "answer": "2 thousandths is nothing. I doubt you will be able to feel this. There is no real spec on the lug torque when checking runout - what is more important is that they are tight and evenly torqued. So you might as well do as Ben suggested and torque to spec. The only real way to reach \"perfection\" is to use a rotor lathe that cuts the rotor while still on the vehicle. The cost is usually insanely prohibitive for these machines. I don't cut rotors anymore, unless it's a very special circumstance. Brand new rotors of high quality are available for cheap. And cutting \"warp\" out of a rotor is a bit of an art and usually takes too much time to be viable.",

      "answer": "The brake rotors are damaged beyond repair by rust. The vent holes are full of rust. This causes the rotors to not cool well enough which can lead to burned spots, warping, pad material overheat and/or pad material transfer to the rotor surface. The pad hanging out over the outer diameter a little bit is not a problem for brake effectiveness. It can lead to noise and premature wear and should be repaired. The pad outer edge should stop at about 2mm from the outer edge. So the solution here is to replace the brake rotors and new pads. The pads could be reused if the new rotors happen to have a slightly large diameter and show no signs of overheating or other damage.",

As far as safety, 2 things: it won't disable the entire braking system, just the anti-locking feature. It's not as critical as the brake calipers, for example. there's a dashlight for the ABS system, so if something went wrong with your installation, the ABS dashlight should remain lit. As far as original Ford part, well 2 things: go to a parts store near you and ask them. Some parts have aftermarket availability, some parts the manufacturers keep for themselves. go to a junkyard. ABS controllers aren't a part that wears out from usage. They do break down, but it's not an age or a mileage thing. A used one from the junkyard would be a good option.",

When I dropped it off at the shop, the brakes were fine, but when I picked the car up afterward, the car now shakes when I brake. It's a pulsing sensation at low speeds (30mph and below) but between 30 and 50 it's a very noticeable shudder and above 50 the car shakes violently. After I got home, I discovered that the parking brake was depressed one \"click\" -- not enough to illuminate the idiot light and I didn't notice any drag while driving. My suspicion is that the pedal got bumped by the tech. I don't know whether that may have been enough to do something. Regardless, I called the shop and they said they didn't touch the brakes at all when they did the tires. I took it back to them, they pulled the drums and said everything looks fine.

      "answer": "Vibration after new tires are installed is not an uncommon problem, and can usually be traced back to improperly weighted wheels or poor alignment. Improperly placed wheel weights would cause a vibration that increased in severity with speed, while vibration from an alignment issue could happen under any number of conditions depending on vehicle condition, suspension geometry, what is out of alignment (Left vs right, front vs rear, toe/camber/caster angles). In your even rarer case, the vibration during braking only was probably caused by the wheel weights contacting the outside of your brakes as pointed out in your picture. As you suspected, this may have prevented the wheels from seating properly on the hubs. Why it only vibrated under braking is beyond me. The easiest solutions would be to find lower profile wheel weights, or install wheel spacers to move the wheels further away from the brakes. From your picture, a simple slide-on 5 or 10mm Aluminum spacer would probably do the trick, though if you go any wider I would recommend hub-centric spacers with separate lug bolts already installed, such as the ones pictured below. On a personal note: I purchased two sets of 20mm spacers for my car (because it looks good) for ~70 USD, about half the price of the name brand spacers (H&R comes to mind). I ordered H&R as well as the cheap ones, and found the 'cheap' brand weighed exactly the same (to the hundredth of a pound), and were concentric to ± .0005\" (I have access to expensive measuring equipment at my work c:).",

Specifically, I'm trying to determine the exact size of the OE brake rotors and their wear tolerance. Searching the web I've found conflicting information. For example, one site lists the original thickness as 29.5mm and the minimum as 25.5. For aftermarket, I've found ones that are 27mm new, and 25mm minimum. Yet, many sites list the OE brake rotor thickness as 25mm and I can't find a minimum for those. The rotors are current at 25mm, so I'm trying to determine if they're relatively new, or need to be replaced.",
      "answer": "The specs are located on the face of the rotor. In order to see them you will be required to remove one of the front or rear wheels. I managed to find a picture showing the location of the markings. The number that's zoomed is the part number of the actual rotor. Using the part number to order the part will make it certain that you get the correct part from the guy behind the counter. If they cannot cross reference the part number because they're systems don't support factory part numbers then a quick call to the dealership parts department giving them the part number, and asking them the specs on the rotor will get the Autozone parts guy the information he needs to hopefully get you the correct part. If you plan on measuring the rotor to check the thickness, this is done with a micrometer and the measurement is taken in millimeters. After the part number there will be a number labeled Min. #mm this is the minimum thickness allowed for the rotor. There will also be a tolerance number (if not .3 is what I use when I cannot find the spec) and a Max.. The tolerance is used like so: if [ (Actual + Tol) <= Min ] ; then ReplaceRotor.

Cars decades ago didn't have a coolant recovery tank, and there was always some amount of air mixed with the coolant. The coolant recovery tank serves two purposes: it prevents coolant from dripping on the ground (and thus being washed into the environment and eaten by wildlife), and keeps air out of the engine (thus making the cooling system more efficient at absorbing heat), but I don't believe it is absolutely necessary.So, will modern engines overheat if there is no coolant recovery tank?",
      "answer": "tl dr; Not directly, but yes. The purpose of a recovery or overflow tank is to allow for expansion of the coolant, then to recover it back into the radiator as things cool off. If the tank is not there (or it all leaks out), the radiator is pushing it out onto the ground without the ability to recover any of it. When things cool off, it sucks air back into the system. The air can cause hot spots with in the engine, same as if you haven't completely or properly burped the coolant system after you refill the antifreeze. It may take some time, but sooner or later you'll have a great enough lack of coolant and your car will overheat. The only way around this is if you are checking and refilling every day before you drive your car. As an alternative, you can seal the crack in your recovery tank until you can purchase a new one. There are plenty of sealants on the market which will do the job for you.",

The car is a 2003 Acura TL type S.",
      "answer": "If you want to know for sure, you can ask the dealer what they use. It would be good to know for the future anyway. There are two main types of anti freeze, generally they all use ethylene glycol as the coolant base; though they differ in the type of corrosion inhibitors used. \"Traditional\" coolants (often green or yellow) generally use silicates, while \"new style\" (generally orange or pink) coolants use organic acids. GM's DexCool is an example of a newer organic acid coolant. These two types shouldn't be mixed if possible, as the effectiveness of the corrosion inhibitors can be reduced. Unfortunately, checking the color of the existing coolant in the expansion tank isn't good enough to confirm a match against what you bought. That said, if you merely need to top up the expansion bottle, you may be able to get away with adding only distilled water, which would be compatible with any coolant. Check the coolant concentration with a hydrometer, and if you've got sufficient coolant concentration, you can simply add water. For what it's worth, apparently someone from the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) said you can safely mix up to 15% of the traditional coolant type into an organic acid type coolant without much of an effect on the corrosion inhibitors. I'd still avoid it if possible. I've personally seen brown sludgey coolant resulting from mixing traditional coolant into VW/Audi's organic acid coolant.",

      "answer": "I am not familiar with G12 coolant, as it seems to be VW/Audi specific, but mixing incompatible coolants will cause precipitation (\"sludge\") within your cooling system, which will cause blockage.

Shake it vigourously for about 25 seconds, then let it sit for 3 minutes then look at it. If you are seeing just one uniform liquid with nothing floating at the top or sinking at the bottom, your fluids are compatible. If you are seeing 2 different layers, large patches floating or big globs at the bottom, your fluids are not compatible.

But assuming a fairly standard coolant, diluted 50/50 with water, and a 15 PSIG cap you're looking at around 265° F or 130° C before things start to boil. The data sheet for the coolant should have a curve for different concentrations and pressures (although 50/50 and 15 PSIG is very standard). Normal operating temperatures for a VW diesels are in the range of 170° F to 210° F with the thermostat set to open around 190° F. The actual gauge is controlled by the ECU and is filtered to read 190° F anywhere in that range (to avoid causing concern at the temperature varies in normal operation). The recommended coolant (G13), when diluted 50/50 has a boiling point of 228° F (109° C) at atmospheric pressure and 248° F (130° C) at 15 PSIG (roughly 2 bar or twice atmospheric pressure). So it seems like what VW is saying is that with these engines somewhere around 40°F (22° C) below the boiling point is a reasonable margin.",

      "question": "Bubbling sound from coolant and increase coolant liquid level",
      "context": "I drive an old Daihatsu Charade 1993. Just 2 days ago, I heard a bubbling sound from the coolant when I turned off the machine. I didn't really care much until yesterday when the car got hot abnormally (3/4 of the gauge, usually 1/4) while idling, though the heat did lessen when the car moving, but it does imply the car has a trouble. Looking back, I guess it has something to do with the bubbling noise I had heard. When I checked the coolant container I saw the liquid is still at just below max level which is fine, no leaking on the ground as well. I drove again this morning, the car didn't get hot and I didn't hear the bubbling anymore, so I thought there wasn't any severe problem (I might be too optimistic). However, that symptom came back again just now when I drove for around 10 minutes. This time I noticed the coolant level got even higher, I still don't have any idea why, but surely it wouldn't be the head gasket thingy since I saw no leaking at all. Now, as I did some research, ",
      "answer": "I suspect you have a leaking head gasket, you don't have to see the coolant leak because it can leak into the combustion chamber and exit your vehicle in the form of vapor from the tail pipe. It can also leak into the oil so make sure to check the oil for contamination. It could also be as simple as a bad radiator cap, you can test them with specialized equipment but they are so cheap I'd just replace it and see if the problem goes away. The job of the radiator cap is to allow the coolant system to pressurize to raise the boiling point. If the cap doesn't' allow the system to pressurize or reduces the amount of pressurization it can allow the coolant to boil and could be the bubbles you are seeing. There is also an easy way to check the head gasket. They make a combustion gas leak detector that detects CO2 in the coolant indicating a leaking head gasket.

Fill the cooling system with about two cups of liquid dishwasher detergent dissolved in hot water. Start the engine and run it until it warms up to regular operating temperature. Drain the detergent solution and flush with tap water again until it runs clean. (The idea here is to remove all oils from the system.) Fill the cooling system with two pounds of citric acid powder (available from industrial chemical supply houses, or from Mercedes-Benz dealers at a considerable premium) dissolved in hot distilled water (since your tap water is hard). Again, start the engine and run it until it warms up to regular operating temperature, or at least fifteen minutes. Flush with distilled water. At this point you should see all sorts of rust, mineral deposits, and miscellaneous crud loosened by the citric acid come out of the drain hole. Refill the system with the appropriate mix of coolant and distilled water.

      "answer": "My garage found a small amount of dried coolant on my radiator and block heater and tell me that I needed to replace my radiator, block heater, and hose urgently, as it could leak at any moment. In order for there to be coolant residue on the outside of places that it should inside that is clear indication that there is or was a leak. Also, seeing the flaky, dried up build-up is an indication that the coolant has been leaking at that point for quite some time, in order for it to build up into the pile you see. If you are checking for the leak while the vehicle is cold and in your garage then this is not the how it should be checked. A small leak [like the one being described in your post is going to be present only when the coolant system is pressurized. If the system is cold (sitting overnight or long enough where the engine is equal to ambient air temperature) then it must be pressurized using a device called a Coolant Pressure Tester. If you were to purchase one of these then you must make sure the adapters for it are for your specific vehicle. There are many different styles different make and model vehicles. If the system is hot (at normal operating temperature), and the leak is big enough, then you might be able to visually see the leak. If not, then you will have to wait until it cools down (in order to ensure that there is no excess pressure in the system) and then pressure test it. Once you've identified where the leaks are then look into replacing those components. It is never recommended to use any type of radiator sealer additive. These products tend to raise the pressures in the system causing more strain on the surrounding components involved in the system. They also, will deposit themselves wherever they land in the coolant system (not how they make it look in the commercials where it goes directly to the leak and creates a perfect patch). The reason why they make it look the way it does in the commercials is because in a perfect world or a controlled",

I've confirmed this with a ODB-II scan tool. According to pg 13 of this document (which is for a 2002, but I assume they are similar), my engine coolant temperature needs to be 176 degrees F for the CAT monitor to start running. My scanner is telling me that my ECT is running at ~160 degrees F. I can't figure out if this means a sensor is busted, or something else (like cold weather) is causing the ECT to be that low. Can anyone recommend a next step that I might try on my own instead of taking it into the shop?",
      "answer": "In terms of possible root causes for failure, the following scenarios are likely culprits for a cooling system to run too cool: A temperature sensor that's reporting lower-than-actual temperatures due to issues like drift/fouling/calibration. A sticking thermostat that is flowing more coolant than necessary to maintain 176 °F. Really cold ambient air temperature which prevents the system from settling down at the desired 176 °F. The most likely culprit based on the information provided is a sticking thermostat: If the temperature sensor malfunctions, one would observe negative temperatures with the scan tool, which in this case isn't happening. While temperature misrepresentation is a possibility, most temperature sensors have a tendency to either work well or not work at all. A stuck-open thermostat will give slightly-below-par engine coolant temperatures, as is the case here. More information is needed about the ambient air temperature in order to comment on it.",

      "context": "In Subarus the thermostat is located at the lower radiator hose, in one body together with the pump, effectively separating water inlet from the radiator to the engine block and core heater. Yet to drain the coolant usually the procedure is to use the drain plug at the radiator. With the thermostat at the lower hose I cant figure out how draining from there is useful or even necessary when we need to drain the engine block side of the circuit. If the thermostat is closed wouldn't coolant continue to remain in the engine-core heater loop anyways because cant get to the radiator drain plug? Does that mean that to completely drain and change the coolant I would have to remove the thermostat? Here is one diagram of the cooling system, old but they havent changed it much (not for what concerns my question at least)",
      "answer": "In a lot of cars, removing just the radiator drain-plug is not always enough to completely flush coolant from your vehicle, as you might suspect. You will most likely need to disconnect the lower hose to flush out more coolant. It's also possible that there are coolant draining plugs on the engine block as well. The reason why coolant must be drained from both the radiator and the engine block is because portions of the coolant is still kept in the radiator when the vehicle is not running, hence to completely flush out all coolant from your system, draining from both points is necessary. I recommend looking into the vacuum filling method for cooling systems, as to minimise the chance of air pockets in your cooling system and in turn to avoid air-locking it.",

If there is reversion, the flame from the lighter will be pulled into the exhaust pipe when lit in front of it. In the dollar bill test, the bill will rattle against the exhaust pipe. Reversion can happen in one of three ways (that I'm aware of): Burnt exhaust valve which no longer seals correctly. Stuck exhaust valve which doesn't seat correctly or gets stuck partially open (which will quickly lead to a burnt exhaust valve). Large amounts of overlap in the cam.

I have a few questions: Is it some kind of heat shield? How vital is it that I replace it? Is it part of some larger assembly that would need to be replaced as a whole? Or is there a good way to reattach it without buying a replacement? Here is where I found it (I've pulled it down somewhat here, it was originally found on top of the pipe): And here it is after I removed it:",
      "answer": "To answer your questions: Yes, this does appear to be a heat shield In general, auto manufacturers don't include anything in the car that they don't need to: this eats into their profits. That being said, it'd be a guessing game as to whether this heat shield was added in order to improve the customer's driving experience (i.e. by reducing the amount of heat that makes it into the cabin and thus allowing the HVAC to operate properly) or if it was added in order to prevent some other component in the system from over heating. All that being said, on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being \"no big deal\" and 10 being \"do not drive the car until it's replaced\", I would place this at a 6-7. Again, it is difficult to know for sure what the heat shield's original intent is. I don't believe the heat shield is part of any larger assembly. The only important thing with a heat shield is that it is sitting between heat source (the exhaust system in this case) and whatever it is trying to shield. If the heat shield is sitting directly on the heat source, it will not operate properly. That being said, you can try finding a way to mount it with zip ties (which may melt...), two-part epoxy (which will be difficult to remove, if needed in the future...), or some sort of fastener. I would probably choose the third of these: I'd drill some small pilot holes in the heat shield and somewhere unobtrusive in the vehicle, and then drive some self-tapping screws through both and call it a ady.",

      "question": "Does exhaust gas pressure impact the output of narrowband lambdas?",
      "context": "In the course of writing this answer I learnt that the current output of wideband lambda sensors is sensitive to exhaust gas pressure. This technical document for Bosch LSU 4.2 widebands explains how changes in absolute gas pressure with alter current signal: 10.6 Pressure dependency of the sensor signal A pressure change of the measured gas gives a deviation of the sensor output signal of: Ip(P) = Ip(P0) * P/(k+P) * (k+P0)/P0 There is also a nice graphical representation of the deviation which I can post up later. I wonder if the same is true for narrowband sensors. They operate quite differently from widebands, but it is known that certain cars dislike certain brands/models of narrowband sensor, even though the waveform should not change.",
      "answer": "There are currently two kinds of narrowband sensors used these days: titania sensors (NTK) and zirconia (Bosch). This answer only addresses the zirconia sensors which are the most common type. Referring to the diagram (which was created by Michael Handrich and shared under a Creative Commons license), the sensor is a galvanic cell that generates what's called the Nernst voltage which is proportional to the natural logarithm of the ratio of the two different oxygen concentrations. Specifically, this is the Nernst voltage equation: dU = -T*k_B/e_0 * ln(c1/c2) Where k_B is the Boltzmann constant in J/K, T is temperature in K, e_0 is the charge of an electron in C. c1 and c1 are both ion concentrations. Another important physical law is Dalton's law which says that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gasses is equal to the sum of partial pressures. p_total = p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + ... + p_n So the ratio of partial pressure of oxygen on one side of the cell to the partial pressure of oxygen on the other is identical to the ratio of ion concentration. It should be apparent that the partial pressure of any particular gas is directly proportional the total pressure (all other things being equal). This means that a higher total pressure on the exhaust gas side should mean a higher concentration of oxygen and therefore a higher voltage compared to the voltage that would be present if there were no pressure differential. That is exactly what your equation says (although it is somewhat curiously related to the current rather than the voltage in that equation). I can't find an authoritative source which gives the exact coefficients for a narrowband zirconia sensor, but I'd expect it to be identical to the equation you gave with the only difference being the values for the constants. Also, since we are talking about a narrow band sensor in this case, the effect would be only on the narrow linear range of the sensor -- \"too lean\" or \"too rich\" voltages would be unchanged.

      "context": "I have recently acquired an old (1989) Mk1 Toyota MR2 and took a few photos of the underside rear of the vehicle. There seems to be a fair amount of rusting on the rear axle and gear box: gear box/exhaust assembly: I was wondering: Can this rusting be prevented from spreading if I only take the car out on dry days (it will be garaged otherwise)? Does the rust look significantly bad; major repair/replacement advised? (The car passed its last MOT last year) How would you manage the rust in the meantime before professional treatment? Thanks in advance.",
      "answer": "From my experience as a LR Defender owner (known for chassis rusting): Rust, once there, can spread. It will not go away. So if you just take it out on sunny days you will not be making it get any better. Sometime or other you will need to get to grips with this rust problem. From what can be seen in the pictures, the muffler seems OK. That's a good start, since this part can be costly for some makes of car, specifically those that weren't produced on a very large scale such as yours. On the other hand, some of the suspension struts seems in a pretty bad way. At the very least, you will have a bad day whenever you will need to take a brake pad off - or, even worse, renew a gaiter on the transmission. I recently had my truck over to a paint shop to get the transmission scraped and repainted (with black chassis paint). This didn't cost more than $300 equivalent, so I guess will be a good investment to preserve the vehicle. They had the skills, tools and products needed to do a professional job, I didn't. Even if you intend to keep the car for a short period of time, I would go ahead and have it done professionaly since the first thing a potential buyer will do will be to have a look at the underside. Additional note: was this rust caused by road salt, by any chance? If so, take a close look at any rubber parts (bushes, gaiters) underneath, they can get dry and split due to the action of salt.

      "context": "I recently purchased an R134a A/C manifold gauge set. As I glanced through its Quick Reference Guide, I noticed bullet point #6 says that I need to turn off the vehicle's engine before attaching the gauge. I thought I was supposed to put on the manifold gauge set when the engine's running and the compressor working so I get the pressure reading at that time. Am I wrong? For safety, must one turn the vehicle's engine off before attaching A/C manifold gauge sets to top off the A/C system?",
      "answer": "It's not necessary, your engine won't explode and your AC system won't burst if you connect the couplers while the engine is running, in fact it will make no difference whatsoever. If the AC system is running the high pressure will be higher pressure than if the AC system is not running, but the worst that could happen would be a more gas could escape if you push the coupler on with the valve closed - a minimal difference. It is prudent though. You typically have three long hoses to deal with, and it's easier than you may think to get the filler line wrapped around the high or low side line and drop it into your engine. If your engine is running then hilarity ensues when it gets wrapped into your serpentine belt or the end gets smacked into your radiator and punctures it, or gets kicked up into your face and punctures that instead. So, if you have a good reason to keep your engine on it's fine as long as you are deliberate and careful, if not then turning your engine off is no big deal, you probably do it several times a day.",

      "context": "I've been reading for a week or so about how AC systems work and problems they could have. One consistent thing I've read is to check how the compressor clutch reacts when you turn on AC - if it disengages then it doesn't have enough pressure and likely has a refrigerant leak. My 94 Cherokee (apparently not great AC systems to begin with) seems to be blowing only slightly cool air when AC is on max settings. However, my clutch seems to be running fine. It never disengages or stutters even for a second. Aside from refrigerant leak, what are some other reasons why an AC system would not be producing much cold air? I figure I'd ask here before I bought some UV dye to try to track down a leak.",
      "answer": "If we're ruling out the possibility of a leak in the system and you're still not getting cold air then it's probably due to normal wear/age. The refrigerant system is supposed to be a sealed system, but this is rarely perfect. If the AC system has never been serviced or it's been many years (6+) since it has been you could be just experiencing normal leakage. Cars are exposed to road vibrations, temperature extremes, and just time. Due to this the seals on the system breakdown slowly. The refrigerant will leak away very slowly and air will be introduced in to the system. You'll continue to have good enough pressure so the clutch engages but not enough to cool the car. Rebuilding the system should make it like new and give you a good 10 - 15 years of life out of it. There's a cost/benefit of rebuilding the system vs a periodic vacuum & recharge. If memory serves me correctly 1994 would have been within the range of when cars were switching from r12 to r134a. My experience is that the first cars to come with r134a had very poor AC cooling in comparison to earlier cars or current cars.",

If your fluid low or do you have a leak in your system. (Check it everyday and make sure you are not losing fluid) Is your coolant mixed correctly. (Make sure you aren't filling up the system with just water or just antifreeze. Buy pre-mixed or mix it yourself to the right proportions). Replace your thermostat.

The best thing to do is change the compressor out if its older at the same time, replacing all the o-rings too.

      "context": "I have a small leak at the top of my air conditioning condenser. Last summer, I tried patching it with JB Weld. They do advertise as working with all metals, but I suspect it failed to hold because it doesn't bond well to aluminum. I could get enough refrigerant in to get some cold air, and then the patch would blow. By the third patch, it seems the hole was getting bigger because it blew very easily. (So, I guess it must have had enough hold to pull some more metal out — d'oh.) How would I go about patching with a torch? My closest experience is with brazing on brass. Just getting a little aluminum plug welded over the tiny hole shouldn't be too bad. What kind of torch, flux, and rod would I use? Is there anything in particular to know about condenser tubing?",
      "answer": "I think most pros will tell you not to bother trying to patch a condenser leak, just replace it. While that's not always an option, it's definitely an option you should consider first. Can you source cheap second-hand unit for your car? Unfortunately condensers and radiators are often damaged in car accidents so second-hand units can be a bit dicey, so make sure you check it thoroughly and try to get a warranty with it. Obviously you could also try sourcing a new OE or aftermarket unit as well. Your next best bet would be to remove the condenser yourself and take it to a radiator repair place and see if they're repair it for you. Removing it (and then fitting it again) yourself will save paying someone for the trouble. A radiator place probably won't charge much for a repair, assuming they think a repair is possible, as it shouldn't really take them very long. It usually takes a lot longer to get the unit out of and into the car than it does to do the actual repair. Failing all that, you could try to do the repair yourself (which was your actual question I know). I'm afraid I know very little about this sort of welding so I'm not qualified to answer, but if you search for radiator repair/welding you should find plenty of info and radiator repair is pretty much the same as condenser repair.

However, I took it on a long trip recently, and on the first 230 kilometers the A/C worked beautifully. Then I stopped someplace, got back in the car to drive again and saw the A/C wasn't working at all. As in the A/C indicator light comes on, air blows, the A/C radiator fan comes on, but the air's not being cooled at all. What I noticed was that when I engaged the A/C, I didn't feel any additional load being put on the engine. Normally, I would expect to see and feel a slight dip in rpms as the compressor comes on, but before the IAC opens up to compensate. This lack of any noticeable additional load and the fact that the A/C operated beautifully for the first 230km of the trip makes me suspect the compressor clutch isn't engaging for some reason. Does this seem like a reasonable guess, how can I verify this, and what",
      "answer": "OK, so the problem turned out to be a torn wire on the compressors' thermal protector: The two ends where being held together by the red cloth casing and making intermittent contact. I had to finish tearing it to get it out. I just stripped the ends of the wires, twisted them together, added some solder, taped it up with electrical tape and reinstalled the thermal protector. Now the A/C is working fine. I followed the \"clutch not engaging\" flowchart in the Civic WSM which is basically: Check the dash and under hood fuses Check the relay Check for battery voltage on the relay plug Short B+ to the clutch wire to see if the clutch closes Check for continuity on the thermal protector and resistance of 3.05 to 3.35 Ohms on the field coil",

The old R12 system had supposedly sprung a leak and the system had emptied, so I decided to convert it over to R-134. I flushed the evaporator, condenser, and all of the hoses separately, and installed a new compressor and orifice tube that came with the conversion kit I ordered.

So you can't pull 30inHg, since then you would have a negative amount of gas molecules inside the system. The highest value you can get is 25inHg. You get 21inHg which corresponds to an altitude of about 11,000ft, so this can't be explained by you being at not exactly 5,000ft. Since the system holds the vacuum, I'd say there's a problem with the device. Either the pump itself or the pipes between pump and valve has a small leak. The pump may be defect, or the oil also used as sealant is low, old or contaminated. (Though it looks and sometimes smells like motor oil, it isn't, and using the wrong oil can heavily affect the performance) Creating a vacuum is not only done to remove water (seriously, how much water could be in there, plus there's a dry cartridge), it's more because it's important to have no other gases except the R-134 inside system. From that point of view, if you can't create a good vacuum, it may be possible to flush the system by adding a little R-134 and removing it again a few times. (I really wonder why the pressure is measured relative to ambient pressure, since this leads to exactly the problem occurring here, too: Not knowing what max. value should be achieved at your location...) Edit: Since people seems to have interest in this graph, here's the formula you can use for excel etc.: Pressure = 1013hPa * exp (- altitude / 8400m) 1013hPa is the normalized air pressure at sea",

      "context": "Car: 2003 Opel Agila 1.2 I would like to retrofit Air Conditioning to my car, as I'm planning to travel to a hot place! My questions: Apart from charging and discharging the system, which I would obviously do at a garage, as everyone knows that AC gas ravages the environment, how long would the job take? Could I do most of it at home? (with a socket set, screwdrivers, a Jack and a hammer) If I had a donor car. with AC, how difficult would this be? (including removing all the AC parts off the old car) What parts would I need to remove from the donor? If I didn't have a donor car, how expensive would it be? As this is just a \"dumb\" AC system with no climate control, just red for hot and blue for cold, is the electrical work for the AC complicated?",
      "answer": "If you have a complete donor car, it is by far easier to swap it out than to retrofit. If the donor car doesn't have an engine in it, level of difficulty goes up exponentially. This is due to not knowing where everything is/was/should be. Also, you'll be on an expedition in parts finding. You'd need to find the right AC compressor, lines, & pulleys which probably wouldn't be there without and engine. Things you'll need to pull out of a donor car: Compressor Refrigerant lines Pressure switch Drier/filter Condenser Evaporator Evaporator housing Heater core (possibly if different than original) Fan Fan resistor pack Switches Wiring (could possibly be there if manufacturer has single wiring harness for vehicle) All associated nuts/bolts/screws/brackets/etc This list is not exhaustive. You will probably find that there are little things which I've not mentioned you'll need. Expect your vehicle to be down for a couple of days while retrofitting. To do this, I'd bet everything pulled out of the donor car first. Anything which touches the bits/pieces you are pulling off needs to be suspect and prepared for movement to receiver car (within reason ... you won't need to introduce the body over, lol!). Do not get rid of donor car until you have the job done. That way if you find you need something you haven't planned for, it will be there.",

      "question": "Why does brake pedal ever move",
      "context": "I don't think my question has any connection to vehicle maintenance or repair but I think this is the closest site to my question topic. My question may be arising from misunderstanding. For that I'm going to assume a few hypothesis. The brake fluid is incompressible(which is correct) and there is no air in the braking system so it doesn't affect its performance. We're assuming there is no brake force boosting effects in the system for the sake of simplicity. If I press the brake pedal and it moves that means that the slave cylinders move.(correct me if I'm wrong) Now my question is if the fluid moves when the slave cylinders move then Shouldn't the fluid be confined for Pascal's to apply? The brake pedal should stop getting further depressed after the slave cylinders press the brake pads and brake disk , is that correct?",
      "answer": "You are correct, the brake pedal should only move when any of the 4 or more slave cylinder pistons move (some vehicles may have multiple cylinders in a caliper). Once the pistons of the slave cylinders are pressing firmly against the brake pads, the brake pedal should in theory become very solid and not possible to press further. There will be some very small amounts of flex in some components, like the flexible brake hoses and even some flexing of the metal parts. When the brake pedal is released, the fluid pressure is released and hence the slave cylinders are able to release pressure on the brake pads. The piston in the master cylinder has a fairly small diameter compared to the diameter of the pistons in the multiple slave cylinders, so the amount of movement of the brake pedal is greatly amplified compared to the brake pad movement. This allows a small amount of pressure (but large movement) on the brake pedal to create a very large pressure (but small movement) on the brake pads. Without this you would find it very difficult to press the brakes hard enough to stop the vehicle. I presume this is the point you are questioning.",

      "context": "When using a front wheel drive car, the rear end is only used for braking. Is it a good idea (and if not, why) to \"reverse\" the tires so the tire threads are useful when braking? I know it might increase the gasoline consumption, but as I'm driving on the snow, it would provide a great bonus.",
      "answer": "Following answer assumes you've got tires with directional thread (if you flip the tire 180 the pattern will mirror upsidedown). Among other duties, tire threads are responsible for \"pumping\" the water out from below the wheel when you drive through it. If you reverse the directional tires then the water will be pumped to under the wheel, effectively providing you with aquaplaning. That can badly affect handling irregardless of drive-wheels positions (fwd or rear). Rear end is useful not only for braking, but for keeping vehicle stable on the road, allowing the car to take corners. Think of it, if you remove rear end traction and have only front 2 wheels, the car will spin (see YouTube for \"half a car\" examples). However if you got bidirectional threads (pattern looks the same if you flip tire 180, see sidewall for rotation direction mark) then you have nothing to worry about, these tires can be installed both ways.",

I went for a test drive in the neighbor and unfortunately, the front driver side brakes started smoking and the rotors actually turned red from the immense heat. I know I messed up and made a noobie and stupid mistake on my part but I'm wondering what else I could've messed up. I'm guessing since the brakes were smoking and the rotors were red (with heat), the rotors are warped. I'm hoping thats the extent of the damage but I'm wondering what else could be affected? To make it short 1) stuck brake caliper, most likely due to bent brake line 2) test drove and braked at 35mph and front driver side brake started smoking, turning bright red and loud noise 3) I tried to take off the caliper but it seemed stuck Questions 1) Outside of brake pad and rotor, what else could be damaged due to a stuck brake caliper? 2) If the caliper is stuck ",
      "answer": "The caliper should be fine once the brake line issue is repaired providing it didn't get hot enough to melt the seals. The pads may appear fine but I would replace them. Pads that got that hot mays have hairline cracks in them. The cracks could eventually cause pieces of the lining to flake off. The rotor is likely in need of replacement also. As far as potential collateral damage the only thing that may be an issue is the front wheel bearing. At the worst you may have taken a few thousand miles off it's life expectancy.

      "context": "I took my car to my local chain repair shop last Saturday because the parking brake was nonfunctional -- the lever, when pressed, had no resistance, and was clearly not hooked up to anything. They diagnosed that the cable had snapped (which seemed reasonable given the symptom), but also that my front roters and pads and my back roters, pads, and calipers needed replacing. Since that was enough repairs to qualify for a payment plan, I threw in an oil change, coolant system flush, and transmission flush, figuring the cost was negligible when amortized over six months of payments and I have a road trip coming up. When I got the car back, I drove it home and set the parking break, and since the lever had resistance to it, I figured it was fixed now. Yay! But Monday morning, forgetting I had set the brake, I put the car in reverse... and it started rolling a little (I live in a hilly region). Curious, I gave it a touch of gas, and it pulled right out of the parking space as though the brake",
      "answer": "I suggest that you take a stand on this one. You are in a position of complete control. Also you will remain within your rights as a consumer and if push comes to shove and the matter was brought to court, the shop would not stand a chance. Let me explain: When you left the vehicle with this shop you had a specific complaint. - Next, the mechanic working on it came to a quick conclusion that the cable must be replaced and it was easy to justify since either it was actually broken or it had just fell off it mounting spot either on the handle side or the e-brake side (either on the caliber itself or inside the rear rotors depending on vehicle). The mechanic then proceeded to estimate all the brakes and included the rear calipers (this is where the red light turns on). Regardless of if the brake pads were excessively worn or not or if the rotors were actually out of spec or even warped is not the issue. The issue is that Your complaint was a braking system issue and they have now estimated 4/5ths of the braking system as a fix/up sell. Then you added the fluid flushes. (they were not recommended.) NOTE: The mechanic working on the vehicle _obviously_ did not check or mention anything about the condition of the fluids that you had decided to service. When it was all said and done. You left with a payment plan for a laundry list of work and services that the vehicle most likely didn't need. I cannot say much about if the vehicle really required the replacement of the brake pads/rotors or of the fluids (obviously). But, I can say that the diagnosis was incorrect, it is possible that the cable was never actually replaced or broken at all. It could have just fell off the handle but, since you would never know the difference between a new cable and an old cable, they just found a way to connect it and stuck with their original story and never took the item off of the bill (and yes, this is quite common practice for a lot of shops). This is where you got the upper hand. After",

      "context": "I have a Civic with a little over 20K miles with the original brake pads and rotors. One of the rear rotors has \"step-like\" grooves on the top and bottom. I visually inspected but can't confirm if there is any brake pad material. The strange part is that all of the other rotors have even wear and are shiny with good brake pads. When driving/stopping, I do not hear any unusual sounds like grinding and squealing and there is no vibration. I went through some of my older pictures and it looks like similar marks were on the rotor a year ago (though, unclear if they were less severe). I confirmed that the caliper is operational and stops the rotor from spinning when the brake pedal is pressed. I am including pictures for reference. What could have caused this type of damage?",
      "answer": "The 2 “step-like” grooves that you describe are all that is remaining of the operational part of the brake rotors. The rest of the surface is covered in rust and is not being used at all for braking. A small area of rust may have initially developed on the rotor which will have acted as an abrasive against the brake pad. A matching groove will have formed in the brake pad so that the pad is no longer pressing against the rotor in that location. With an area of the rotor no longer being scrubbed by the pad, rust will slowly spread out sideways, wearing more of a groove in the pad. This continues until you all you have left of the rotor is as in your photo. You need to replace the rotors and pads on both sides of the axle to ensure even braking. Never reuse old pads on new rotors, even if the pads have plenty of thickness, since any slight grooves in the pads will immediately allow rust to form on the new rotors.",

      "context": "I am trying hard to unscrew these two bolts. I've tried to hit, to heat it with a torch and I put lot of WD40. Nothing moves. What am I doing wrong?",
      "answer": "I think the issue the OP has is that he has limited tools, and may be trying to turn things which have a little rust, and possibly were over-torqued during assembly. So it may be helpful to talk about ways to get fasteners loosened where the threads may be unwilling to smoothly turn apart. Stuck fasteners or guide pins, are often over torqued in the previous assembly. While caliper retainer bolts are usually torqued to moderate torque levels, like 40 to 60 foot-pounds, caliper pins often have lower torque specs, like 15 foot-pounds. Second, rust tends to be an issue for most of us, and an undisturbed fastener or caliper pin may have enough rust in the thread area to make removal difficult. Here are some suggestions: If possible, pre-soak the area a couple of days in advance, to help get the oil in as far as possible. Percussion (not 5# hammer in full swing) helps shatter oxide in the threads. If an Allen or Torx fastener, tap on the tool with it planted into the fastener. It helps to reapply penetrating oil after tapping. If things look bad, you might try several cycles of tapping and oil. Using an socket drive extension or a metal rod, may help you get the percussion delivered, without risking other things in the area. Percussion reduces the need for brute force, which helps minimize fastener breakage and tool breakage. While air / electric impact wrenches are very handy these situations, there are a few alternatives. Hand impact tools, where a hammer is used to hit a tool, which drives a cam inside the tool, rotating a socket or bit installed on the tool can be very helpful. Even on brake parts. These handheld impact tools are usually about $20 from Sears, HFT and other places. Other higher priced solutions include air/electric impact tools and torches and welders. If using a torch, the best is something like oxy-acetylene. High heat, applied just to the fastener, causes a slight expansion of the fastener, and corresponding pressure within the threads.

You would have to contact other manufacturers to find out if they use asbestos in any particular pad you are interested in, I would not trust any parts store to know this. \"In 1989, the EPA proposed a ban on the manufacture, import, processing, and sale of asbestos-containing products to be phased out over seven years. But asbestos industry supporters challenged the ban in court. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the first stage of the EPA ban -- which prohibited new uses of asbestos, **banned imported asbestos products, and ended the asbestos use in roofing and flooring felt, sheeting and tile, and clothing -- But overturned the second stage, which would have stopped asbestos use in products such as brake drum linings, automotive transmission components, gaskets, and other friction parts, as well as in the production and use of roof coatings, brake blocks, paper, pipe, and shingles made with asbestos. A changing landscape: Asbestos in North America Nevertheless, the automotive industry in the US recognizes the threat asbestos-containing brake part imports posed to auto mechanics’ health, and in 2010 California and Washington passed legislation that will require brake pads sold or installed in these states to have reduced levels of copper (no more than 5% by weight by January 1, 2021 in both states and no more than 0.5% copper by weight in California by January 1, 2025) and other heavy metals (no more than 0.1% by weight of asbestos, cadmium, chromium, lead, or mercury as of January 1, 2015).

Start by looking at both of them carefully, you may see an obvious difference. Failing that, if you have appropriate measuring tools, see if you can find a difference that accounts for the misfit. If that doesn't work, then it is likely that the hub is off somehow and you'll need to sort that out. One other thing to look at is the caliper itself, if it floats then it is possible that the caliper has hung up and could be freed and centered so that it would fit.

Cars sitting in rain get their rotors rusty all the time and the rust comes off on the first use of the brakes. Again, I don't see an issue with this and now that you mention it, when I find a good deal, I'll probably do the same thing. Thanks for a good idea.",

      "context": "I am planning to replace my front brake pads within a month. I was told that if my brake wear sensor trips, I will need to buy new sensors as they will get destroyed. So I am trying to save my brake wear sensors by replacing the front brake pads before the sensor actually trips. For that, I am looking for a very rough estimate on how many kilometers I can do before my front brakes wear out by 1mm (this is how much is left before sensor tripping). This is considering mix of city/highway non-aggressive, slow braker style driving. The car make is a 14 ' Audi S4 (B8.5).",
      "answer": "Here's a rough approach that should work regardless of vehicle You will need to know the current brake pad thickness the thickness of a brand new brake pad how much mileage you've put on the car since the last brake pad change. The formula Mileage per mm = mileage since last brake change / ( brand new thickness - present thickness ) In essence, this formula assumes a linear wear rate. Example New E39 M5 brake pad thickness = 10 mm Old E39 M5 brake pad thickness = 2 mm Mileage accrued = 25,000 km Mileage per mm = 25,000 km / ( 10 -2 ) mm = 3,125 km per mm So I can now anticipate roughly when the next brake pad replacement is due before the brake wear sensor trips.",

      "context": "Took my 2006 VW Touareg in for servicing and had the dealership replace the rear brake pads and discs. In a post-replacement test drive the dealership discovered that one of the sides has a stuck caliper, and the brake doesn't want to let go. The dealership called to check if we had experienced sticky brakes in the past. Having ruled that out as a possibility, they are now recommending to have the caliper replaced, and if that doesn't fix it the ABS unit as well - all at my expense. I'm reluctant to believe that the caliper failed at the same time the brake hardware was upgraded. By suggesting the ABS unit, I believe they're simply insuring themselves against liability claims in the future (\"we told you so\"). The brakes were fine prior to the servicing and brake hardware refresh, so what could possibly have happened to cause one of the brakes to stick like that? Could the presence of excessive brake fluid explain this? With this question I'm looking to elicit technical reasons for what",
      "answer": "It sounds to me like they cocked the piston in the caliper sideways when they collapsed it during the brake job. This could be caused from a worn caliper piston. It may or may not have been their fault, but would be hard to prove. My suggestion is to have the caliper replaced. This should fix the issue. I don't see any way this could be related to the ABS unit, unless they think the brake fluid is not being allowed to migrate back up the lines after braking. I've not heard of a unit creating it's own one way check valve, though. I'm not sure how the Toureg's brakes transition (slide). This may be an area of concern as well. If the slides are rusted or otherwise obstructed, this could be causing an issue, but would assume the mechanic would have picked up on this.",

      "answer": "In the caliper, the seal is designed so when you press the brake pedal and fluid enters, the seal twists sideways. When you release the brake pedal, the force of the seal pushes the piston and thus the fluid back, which returns it into the master cylinder. There is enough slide in the seal it allows the piston to move forward if needed to take up space from worn brake pads or during brake maintenance. This action retracts the piston so the pad doesn't constantly stay in contact with the rotor surface.",

      "context": "My car is a Chevrolet Lumina 2001. About 2 months ago I changed the radiator of my car because it was leaking, the guy that changed the radiator got the radiator in a junk yard place for cheap price. Now, I found that it's leaking again and that it's coming from a crack. I decided then to buy a new radiator now online and get it fixed when it gets here. The problem is that I was planning on going on a road trip for this coming long weekend, although I have noticed that the radiator takes time to get empty (about a day) I keep putting more coolant when I go to work which is about 50 miles from where I live so 100 miles every day so I don't have problems with overheating. I have noticed that it leaks more when it's hot (which makes sense since it has more pressure and tends to leak more than when its cold). Anyway, the question is, is there any temporary fix that I use so I can be safe for that trip? The radiator is going to arrive next week so I was thinking if even if there's no other ",
      "answer": "If you can see and access the crack, a two-part epoxy or something like JB-Weld can be great for a temporary fix. This page shows the process on a metal radiator for a race car, but your fix would be similar. Clean the site of the repair, and rough up the surface with fine sand paper, especially if working on plastic. Mix the two-part epoxy and generously apply to the crack. If the crack is on a vertical surface, you may have to build a \"dam\" out of tape or something to keep it from running off of the cracked area. If you attempt this, plan on breaking down. It will probably get you to your destination, but you need a plan for the worst case. Carry several gallons of water/antifreeze. Pack a blanket if it's cold outside.

      "context": "Not as much a maintenance question but I'm hoping to get a better understanding of how my vehicles work. In 2016 I bought a 2012 Chevy Cruze which was fairly heavy on coolant consumption. Since I bought the vehicle I've found myself topping up the coolant every two months or so, and I believe once or twice have had to repair the coolant system. Because this was my first vehicle I assumed topping up coolant this regularly was normal and common across all vehicles. Then in 2022 I bought a new Chevy Equinox which is quite the opposite, it barely uses any coolant at all and I've not really had to top it up much. This is to the point that I wonder if I'm doing something wrong with this vehicle compared to the Cruze. My base assumption is that the Equinox is engineered better than the Cruze which came ten years earlier. But I'm curious to know what the cause is for the difference, and if my Cruze is just an oddball model that takes a lot of coolant.",
      "answer": "Your assumption would be incorrect. A vehicle's coolant should be self contained and not needing topped off. If it routinely needs this, then there's a problem with the cooling system. It is losing coolant either through the combustion process or it's leaking it. The combustion process is a leak by the cylinder head gasket(s) and into the cylinder, or there may be (less likely) a crack in one of the castings allowing the coolant to flow into the cylinder(s). If there's a leak, it can either be coming out of the radiator, piping, or heater core. This would most likely be noticed. A leak could also exhibit itself through coolant being in the oil, which can come from a leaking head gasket into an oil passage, but this would be exhibit itself through milky looking oil (sometimes called \"chocolate milkshake\"). The only time a coolant system may need topped off is after a routine maintenance, and then only once or twice to ensure it remains full. Sometimes during maintenance (coolant replacement), there may be a few trapped air bubbles in the system which get flushed out. When this happens, more coolant would be needed to replace the bubble and therefore you need to top off. More than likely your Cruze has an issue with the cooling system and your Equinox doesn't.",

      "answer": "From the different forum posts I've been looking at, 105℃ is about normal. It may get a bit higher under spirited driving. I don't think you have anything to worry about with the coolant temperature. What worries me about your situation is the coolant drop. Your surge tank/reservoir should not be fluctuating that much. Either the engine is burning coolant or you have a leak somewhere. The only thing which would mitigate this in my mind is if you are not looking at the coolant levels at the same time of vehicle usage. If you are running your vehicle for an extended period of time, the level in the surge tank/reservoir is not going to be at the same level as when the vehicle has been sitting overnight and is completely cooled off. So ensure you are reading apples-to-apples when taking a look. Coolant does not usually evaporate from the system as it is a sealed system. If your levels are below the \"low\" mark, there could be an issue. You will not do yourself (or your car for that matter) wrong by keeping an eye on it. If, in a few days, you notice the level has dropped again significantly, I'd have it into BMW for some maintenance. Keep a close eye on the levels as you don't want to overheat your car. If it stays relatively the same over the next couple of weeks, I doubt you have anything to worry about.",

Regarding the cylinder head image: The blue markings are coolant passages. The green and black ones are oil passages and bolt holes. What about those RED passages which are smaller than others? I guess they might also be oil passages but since the engine is a wet liner and coolant is flowing around the liners, no oil can circulate through the red holes because oil & coolant will mix and it doesn't make sense to me. Please tell me what those red holes really are.",
      "answer": "Looking at the images you provided, I've added some arrows to help with my explanation. I've tried to match the arrow colors to the circle colors to help as well. If you look at the two black arrows, these are bolt holes for the head bolts. There are ten total going around exterior of the cylinders, four bolts circling each cylinder (yes, six of the 10 bolts pull double duty in their clamping). On the head gasket, you can see the light green stripe which winds its way around the outside of all of the cylinders, but inside of the holes for the bolts. This is important, because everything inside of this circle is wet (whether oil or water) and everything outside of it is dry. The light green stripe provides a seal against liquids escaping the engine. The green arrow points to a large hole near the end of the gasket. There is the light green line which completely encircles this. This is the oil return hole, where oil can go back to the pan after it's done what it does in the top of the head. There are actually three of these holes, but there are only two circled on the cylinder head. The third hole is on the upper left end right adjacent to the bolt hole. As you stated, this is an open deck block with wet cylinder liners. The coolant flows around it. If you look at both the red and light blue circles on the head portion of the image, you can see all of these fall within the coolant zone of the head gasket and align with the open areas of the block. All of these are coolant passages. They are just shaped a little differently than the larger holes which are circled in light blue. If you look closely at the head, you can see a sort of off colored area (a little lighter) which is around the round holes circled in red. These areas are of the same size and shape as the larger ones circled in light blue. Why Peugeot did it this way I don't have a clue.",

I drained the coolant from the bottom of the radiation. Then I closed petcock and put in some radiator flush and cleaner into the reservoir then topped it off with distilled water. I now realize that I don't think I drained all of the coolant since I only put in about half a gallon of fluid. I can't remove the thermostat because the bolts got stripped when I changed it a few months ago. I noticed a build up of some sort of mineral solid when I replaced the thermostat so that is when I figured a coolant flush would be good. How can I fix any possible problems I may have caused? How do I get the coolant back to the proper concentration? I was letting the car run and was monitoring the reservoir level to add more water when I noticed that the reservoir was bubbling. I quickly turned it off, any help is appreciated. I had checked it at about 5 minute",
      "answer": "Some vehicles don't have any other means of draining other than the petcock, and given your problem with the thermostat housing, you should probably leave that alone unless you want to replace it, which might be a good idea if it has mineral build up. It would be better to drain from the radiator, and fill with the correct coolant over several times. If its a DIY, you could do it over a few weekends. You will gradually reach a point where the coolant is clean and not contaminated by the flushing product. If you are set on doing it in one go, it is a bit more difficult and messy. You could remove all the easily accessible hoses and flush using a hosepipe with fresh water. Try to get the heater core hoses and the lower radiator hose. In this case, you will have filled the system with tap water, you should then fill with concentrated coolant to achieve the correct ratio. (don't use ready-mix if you have introduced water). Also, if you have hard tap water, you might want to avoid this method. The best solution would be to use a combination of the above methods, that's what I did when I had used the wrong coolant.

      "answer": "There's a huge amount of information you would need to know about your \"theoretical car\" before even a wild guess could be made. As Rory mentioned, velocity is key. Sage old-school guys like Corky Bell chasing the best Volumetric Efficiency say this velocity needs to ideally about .7 mach on intake, and maybe a third of that on exhaust. But any \"wive's tale\" like that really is making a large number of assumptions. Any expansion in exhaust diameter means a pressure drop, and by Boyle's Gas law we can expect a temperature drop as well. Which means slower, cooler exhaust gas, which is a restriction all by itself. You might even \"wrap\" the exhaust with high-temperature insulating material to maintain heat and velocity, but this tends to rot out everything in a hurry unless you fabricate in good austenitic stainless like 318 or 321. On the other hand, exhaust will cool as it travels, so keeping the exhaust path as short as possible, with minimum bends, is also a design ideal. Complicate all this with what you objectives are: Horsepower? Torque? Ultimate VE? A car that actually can be driven over the entire rev range? All these things are in direct competition. There is no magic bullet. Does my juridiction require a muffler? A catalytic converter? Can I discharge exhaust safely under the doors? A \"No-rules\" exhaust design would be a gradually tapering funnel, port-matched to manifold outlet size, and then the straightest shot possible, growing slightly over the length to allow for cooling without impeding velocity, but still long enough to provide a scavenging effect for better cylinder filling and torque. Probably short of impossible on anything but a specialized race vehicle with a narrow powerband and no street \"laws\" to be concerned about.

      "question": "How to install a California oxygen sensor into a federal catalytic converter assembly?",
      "context": "I have a 2000 Mitsubishi Galant ES 2.4L Engine with California emissions. Installed is a new federal catalytic converter assembly. The problem is that I do not know what kind of oxygen sensor to install into the assembly, because the vehicle is from California. I am looking for a solution that requires me to NOT replace the entire assembly since the assembly is brand new. Are there adapters available that convert the oxygen sensor's plug from federal to California?",
      "answer": "Looking at the description of the California O2 sensor for your car, the only thing different on it (besides the internals) is the electrical plug. The wrench which you tighten it down with is 7/8\", which means the sensor bung should be the same size as well. I don't think there is any real external difference between the California and non-California sensor. You should be golden here. If the car came with California emissions on it (and it's no longer garaged in CA), you'll still want to put a CA O2 sensor on it or it will probably throw a code. The reason is, the vehicle computer will be looking for a certain input from the sensor. If it is getting readings something other than what it expects, you get an exception and a check engine light. The CA O2 sensor should fit right up into the new cat ... the bungs are pretty much standard on all American vehicles (and probably most other vehicles through out the world as well).",

      "question": "Sheared off exhasut pipe: How to fix without a welder?",
      "context": "The exhaust pipe on my 2005 Malibu has sheared off and is causing excessive noise. I would like to temporarily repair the pipe in order to reduce the noise that is being caused by the broken pipe. It's ok if the repair isn't permanent; I plan to replace the car in 6 months. It's ok if the repair doesn't completely eliminate the excess exhaust noise; a little bit of noise is fine. Unfortunately, I only have basic mechanical skills & tools, and do not have a welder. For those that are wondering: The local automotive shop is unwilling to repair the pipe--they want to replace the entire part, including the catalytic converter--which is cost prohibitive ($1200+). Is there a way to repair the pipe without the use of a welder?",
      "answer": "To expand on what Mike said, the easiest/cheapest way to fix this is by creating a sleeve. Use some thin metal which is fairly easily bendable. Actually, using a large metal can body like you'd find holding canned food should work. Cut the two ends out of it, then split it up the side. The can has to be big enough to completely wrap the tail pipe and overlap. Then take two jubilee (aka worm gear clamps) to hold this part in place. Consider getting some Permatex Ultra Copper gasket maker to line the inside of the can with. The idea with it is to not only seal it, but to hold things in place. Also, cleaning off the two ends of the exhaust pipe with a wire brush or wheel will help as well. Tighten the clamps as good as you can. The tighter the better, but dont crush the exhaust pipe. This should suffice for a bit while you get the money to replace the parts. It won't last forever, but I'd expect it to last 4-6 months depending on your climate and what shape the rest of the exhaust is in. Please note, if you have a safety and/or emissions inspection, this will NOT pass muster.",

      "context": "First, sorry if this is a duplicate. I searched for similar symptoms on this site and found no other issues where the problem went away on its own. Yesterday after five minutes of neighborhood driving, I accelerated after a right-turn-on-red (so accelerating a little heavily) and saw a great deal of white (maybe blue) smoke coming out of my tail pipe, and at the same time experienced a loss of acceleration (or perhaps my transmission shifted in a strange way, I'm not sure) then the smoke was thin (almost none) and the acceleration returned to normal. I drove home (a few blocks) let the car sit for a few hours and then took it for a spin to see if there was any smoke. There was none. I drive a 2013 Hyundia Elantra sedan with automatic transmission. Why would I get a lot of smoke out of my car, and then the smoke goes away? All of the issues I've read about do not seem like problems that would go away. Edit: The mechanic replaced a PCV valve that was stuck open. An answer listing this as",
      "answer": "Per your edit, you said the mechanic replaced a PCV valve that was stuck open, causing the excessive smoking. PCV in this case stands for Positive Crankcase Ventilation. The valve is located on the side of the engine block, and serves to vent excess pressure out of the crankcase. The pressure is created by the churning and heating of oil, as well as some of the combustion gasses escaping past the piston rings into the crankcase (known as blow-by). Because the extra pressure in the crankcase often contains atomized oil and in some cases un-burnt fuel, the PCV valve routes these gasses back into the intake plenum, such that they can be used in the combustion cycle and exhausted out the tailpipe. When your PCV valve was stuck open, the hard acceleration excited and heated the oil, and the higher levels of blow-by caused by high engine RPM allowed (relatively) large amounts of that oil through the valve into the intake plenum, causing the white smoke you saw. It does not take much oil to create a large cloud of smoke, so you may not even notice the oil level went down if you were to check the dipstick.

      "question": "Single Cylinder 2 stroke bike with twin exhaust, will it need two chambered exhausts?",
      "context": "I am asking specifically about Yezdi (not in production anymore) 250/350cc motorcycles. Yezdi RoadKing was a 250cc single cylinder two stroke with twin exhaust. If upgrading to a calculated chambered exhaust, will it need two chambered exhausts or just one? I was told that for two strokes, only a single exhaust is needed for a single cylinder (should there be multiple cylinders) and that separate exhaust pipes will be required for each cylinders (ie, exhaust gases from more than one cylinder can not go into one exhaust pipe. Hence the number of cylinders and exhaust pipes will be equal).",
      "answer": "Two stroke engines, by their very nature, require some of the 'plumbing' you note in your question. Specifically the expansion chamber. Unlike 4-stroke engines, two-stroke engines require the expansion chamber and stinger (reduced diameter over distance) at the end of pipe. The energy in the exhaust wave expands and wave front slows in the expansion chamber and then accelerates as the diameter decreases to the stinger and bounces back toward the front of the pipe to stuff escaping hydrocarbons (unburned fuel) back into the cylinder head. A Jawa engine is probably installed in your Yezdi Roadking. Here's the weird part. You have two exhaust ports, if I am correct, coming off the head. You could custom build a pipe with expansion chambers that join together, perhaps. Seems a bit painful. There are aftermarket pipes that are properly calculated and join into a single expansion chamber. For aesthetics, performance and ease of procurement I would go with two new and independent systems with calculated expansion chambers. They won't 'conflict' with one another and would IMHO look much better than a bastardized expansion chamber thing, which in my mind would be created by trying to combine into a single pipe with expansion chambers.",

      "answer": "This NIH (National Institutes of Health) Study monitoring CO inside the cabin of a vehicle during commutes over an extended period has some pretty interesting data. From the study the mean CO concentration was 9.8 ppm, with a standard deviation of 5.8 ppm Here is another study Here is another study that reflects older data ('80's and '90's) sampled from several metro areas that you may be familiar with. I discovered some additional studies that would show cars idling on warmup with the vent sent to 'fresh air' in the winter where the CO levels went as high as 8,000 ppm! So it seems that are within normal operation limits or that your exposure to CO does not seem out of the normal variance.

      "context": "For some time now I've been getting a considerable amount of dark smoke from my tailpipe on cold starts which I believe to be an oil burning issue. I have an oil consumption test in progress, so far it seems to be about a quart every 1k miles. Typically in the morning the engine starts fine, but then immediately sounds like it is struggling to stay running. This is when the smoke starts coming out of the tailpipe. Usually the engine and smoke clear up after 10 seconds or so. This morning, however, the engine completely stalled during this ignition phase. This has never happened before. There is no engine light and everything runs fine otherwise. I have a clean MAF, clean throttle body, brand new spark plugs and cables, and several bottles of techron through the tank for the injectors within the past few months. Mileage is about 81k. Any ideas?",
      "answer": "Oil consumption in the LM7 engines is pretty common. The L33 in my '06 Silverado is around the same amount, maybe a little less. What you are talking about sounds more like a stuck/leaky injector. Oil smoke will usually last longer than 10 seconds, if that were the issue. And it would be distinctly blue, not black/dark. The way you could tell if this was the issue is to put a fuel pressure gauge on the fuel rail. Ensure the fuel pressure is good (I don't remember off the top of my head, but believe it should be in the 53-60psi range). Then, shut the engine off and allow the vehicle to sit overnight with the fuel gauge on it. If there's no leak, you should get a minimal amount of fuel pressure loss ... maybe 10-15psi, but if there is a leak, you'll get a much more dramatic drop or all of it for that matter. This doesn't mean it is specifically a fuel injector leak. It could also mean that the fuel pump anti-drain back isn't working right, but if the anti-drain back weren't working right, it wouldn't start up as easily as you describe.",

I bought a used one from the junkyard, and it fired right up after I got it put in, and all the wires, hoses, etc. connected. The only thing that I don't have hooked up is the exhaust pipe. I've got the manifolds on the motor, and the Y pipe is lined up on both of the manifolds. The gaskets won't be here until the morning, so I just hand tightened the bolts.

      "answer": "With the check engine light on, the car is going to be running a fixed set of parameters from the Engine Control Module. For instance Fuel Pressure will be held at max pressure and timing and spark adjustments (if done electronically) will not retard or advance. One of the reasons this happens is because the Engine Control Module is not recieving all of the needed information from the required sensors in order for it to calculate things like fuel mixture, timing (spark/valve), etc. This will also in turn affect transmission points. Where as Transmission Pressures are usually set to max during a fault situation and if the fault is specific to the Transmission then it will force only 2nd and 4th gears (limp home mode). All in all. Get that exhaust hung properly, clear all your codes, and repeat your test drive. As long as you didn't forget to plug something in somewhere and all the parts are good then, I think you will be just fine.",
